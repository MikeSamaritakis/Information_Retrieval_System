  "Content": "Anyone know anything about the 1961 Harley Topper scooter. It has less than 5000 miles on it and it was starting up as recently as three months ago. Any help on this would be greatly appreciated. I am not getting a spark from the spark plug. I already checked the spark plug, even replaced it. I removed the key ignition switch and it is operating correctly. I ohmed out the coil and tested it with a 6v battery. I cleaned the ignition and light breakers in the magneto and checked their gaps. Those were all the magneto parts I could get to. Can anyone tell me how to test the magneto output without removing it from the scooter and placing it on a bench?\n\nJohnD",
