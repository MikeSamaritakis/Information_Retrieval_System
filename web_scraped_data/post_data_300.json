  "Content": "Hi all,\n\nbought a new to me used bike last week and thought the tires looked in good shape, but I saw this today. In this a wear mark or something that just got stuck in the tire\u2026almost looks like it gauged out another part of the tire. If they\u2019re still in good condition, can I just take it to the tire shop and have them fill it? How much do I need to worry about this?\n\nThanks!\n\nJames",
