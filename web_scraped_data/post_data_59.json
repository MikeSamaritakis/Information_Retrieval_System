  "Content": "Hey guys. Wondering if anyone has found or is running a dash cam on their motorcycle. I have one in my car, no reason not to have one on the bike. Near misses are a daily thing here so it would be smart. I would like one on the helmet but having to plug/unplug, deal with batteries, and turning on/off will be a huge pain. Id rather one mounted to the front of the bike, turn on/off with the bike and cycle video's. More so to prove what I was doing if I get hit.\nThanks!",
