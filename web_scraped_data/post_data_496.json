  "Content": "It's a dark rainy day here in Bloomington, Indiana and my bike is in the shop getting the cam chest serviced. Sipping on some bourbon and trying to make good use of my time\n\nWith that, I'm curious. What is your favorite route ever? With no ego I can say we've ridden over 150,000 miles in the last 4 years while visiting every major scenic byway in the country. It's hard to narrow down a favorite, but Beartooth Pass may be it for me. Lots of curves, breathtaking views, wildlife, the list goes on. My first trip on this route actually got me a little emotional. It is absolutely gorgeous! Having a snowball fight in the middle of summer was also kinda neat.\n\nHonorable mentions to the following: Million Dollar Highway, Going to the Sun Road, General's Highway.\n\nAll of my favorites in general are out west.",
