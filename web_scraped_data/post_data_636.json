  "Content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI bought my motorcycle a few months ago probably in June 2023 and it has never truly idled properly. I stalls on me quite frequently. I don\u2019t ride it a lot for this reason, but I am not sure how to fix it and make it idle smoothly.\nI recently pulled out the carburetor and cleaned the jets, I added new spark plugs cause those went bad as well and I got a new battery installed. I can start the bike and when I have the choke all the way out it\u2019ll idle just fine. If I put the choke back in, it dies on me, unless I\u2019m pulling the throttle. I can ride it just fine usually, but anytime I come to a stop or near stop it dies. So now it dies anytime I\u2019m standing still on it.\nHas anyone had these issues before? Should I mess with the idling PMS screws? I would do this, but they are capped off and this makes me believe the manufacturer doesn\u2019t want them to be accessed. Should I clean the carburetor again?\nAnother interesting thing I found is that the throttle cable screw was all the way loose and held in place by a zip tie\u2026 not sure what that was about but hopefully it gives some extra info.\nAnything helps, I just want to get it running smoothly hopefully.",
