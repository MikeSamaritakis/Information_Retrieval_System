  "Content": "I've had my bike for sale for a little over a year now with not much interest being shown. Just received an email from a guy who seems very interested, legit, and is offering within $100 of my asking price, but... I turned him down. Why? Because he has no experience riding, does not have his license yet, and I know how quickly things can go off the rails with just 40hp, much less 100 additional horses. While I am eager to sell, I also want to be a responsible seller and not \"taint\" this guy's learning curve/experience.\n\nYour thoughts?",
