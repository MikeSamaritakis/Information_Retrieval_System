Anyway, I reluctantly parted with £83 ($106) for another year of motorcycle bliss.\nHowever, after talking to a friend in London, I was horrified to discover that our capital is officially the world's most expensive place to insure a bike... £942 ($1200). For a experienced rider with an advanced licence.\nI will never complain again! Then again., me riding in London? You've got more chance of seeing a sea sponge playing a banjo. 🤣",
