  "Content": "I am looking at a 2003 Yamaha FJR1300 with 16,500 KMS (10,300 Miles) on it. He has it for sale for $5900.00 CAD. I heard there could be a few problems with the earlier models, The biggest being an exhaust seal problem.\n\nDoes anyone have any experience with these. The price is right and the mileage very low and it's in very good condition with just a few minor scratches. What is the consensus?",
