  "Content": "Hello, I live in Istanbul / Turkey. I bought a street triple 675 last week. 2016 model. I bought the engine cheaply, but of course there are some shortcomings and since the euro rate is high, I want to do it myself as much as I can.\n\n1- when the engine starts from the clutch, a sound similar to a friction sound comes from the clutch. I think this is a general problem in these motorcycles. do I need to change the clutch plate? when I squeeze the clutch lever, the sound goes away.\n\n2- sometimes the tachometer does not work but the blue warning light works. is this a socket problem?\n\n3- when I first bought it, the abs light was not on when I brought it to the garage, but this morning the abs light was blinking even though I started it and moved. is it related to the socket.\n\n4- Red liquid is flowing from a plastic reservoir next to the crankcase of the engine, similar to antifreeze.",
