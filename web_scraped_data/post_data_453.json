  "Content": "I am 5'6\" and naivley ordered Alpinestars Andes Drystar Pants in Medium SHORT, thinking that the waist is the same as their regular leg medium version, just with shorter legs. Wrong. Alpinestars somehow assumes that when you order pants with shorter legs you are also thinner, so they shaved off 4\" in the waist. So they are unsuitable for me (I usually wear pants with 32-33\"stated waist, and 28-30\" inseam).\n\nAny recommendations for good riding pants in Medium, but with shorter legs, and otherwise the same pants as those with regular length legs?\n\nP.S.: I prefer the non-jeans, non leggings type. I.e. heavy-duty waterproof pants with pockets and zippers.\n\nThanks,\nJM",
