  "Content": "Recently picked up an 83 nighthawk 550, Started checking over the bike and i noticed the air filter was just sitting loose in the air box. The air filter is about 1 inch too low from sealing with the top of the airbox so its pretty much been bypassing the filter for who knows how long. Bike has 20k kms on it hope it wasn't always running like this. Part number 3 in the diagram #17216-ME5-000 is the part i need cant find it anywhere, hoping you guys might know of a better solution then a block of wood to prop the filter up.",
