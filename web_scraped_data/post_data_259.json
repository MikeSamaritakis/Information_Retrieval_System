  "Content": "Hello!\n\nI just purchased my first bike (new rider). 2003 Honda Shadow 750 ACE. ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜ðŸ¤˜\n\nI'm wanting engine guards/crash bars, as this is my first bike. I really like the horn design, but I can't seem to find this style that would fit (per specs and listings)\n\nDoes anyone have any suggestions or can point me in the right direction for guards/bars that would fit.\nðŸ’¸ I am also needing to stay at or below the $175 mark.\n\nThanks!!!! ðŸ¤˜",
