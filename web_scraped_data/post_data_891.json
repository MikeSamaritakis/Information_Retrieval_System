  "Content": "Hi all,\n\nGot the bike out earlier after a break of a couple of months. Since it's a nice dry day I thought I'd run an errand from Chester to Ormskirk. But didn't realise it would be so windy...\n\nI sure did get a fright with some of those gusts of wind, especially on the M57 and M58. I checked the Met Office website afterwards and gust speeds in those areas were 39mph.\n\nI've experienced serious wind before (ho ho ho!) particularly in Scotland. One time I had really consistent side winds in open country and was leaning against it. Must've looked weird to the driver behind me. Another time experienced really strong gusts on the massive hill that leads down towards Perth (think it was there anyway).\n\nOn today's ride, I got hit by some nasty but random gusts. The first one took me a little by surprise and briefly altered my direction of travel. My response was to duck behind the screen more and make myself smaller, and keep the throttle up, although limited myself to more like 70mph. I also found that it helped to tense up my core and back muscles as if in a bracing posture for when the next hit came along, although some people say it is better to relax, I'm not so sure. I wanted to be in full control of how the handles and front wheel moved.\n\nWeirdly, by the time I was heading home on the M56 and dealing with more like 29mph winds, it seemed a doddle in comparison, although still a bit rough, and I had more of a \"**** yeeeaaaahh!!\" attitude.\n\nAnyway... feel free to share your stories and tips, and also... what is your limit when it comes to wind speed? At what point is it too dangerous?\n\nPs. Suzuki V Strom 650 in my case.",
