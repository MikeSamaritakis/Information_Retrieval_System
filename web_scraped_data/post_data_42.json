  "Content": "Hello, I\u2019m hoping I might be able to get some help with questions I have regarding my v star im trying to fix up. It is seemingly having symptoms of running both lean and rich. I have cleaned my carbs, cleaned my air filter, checked all air/ fuel hoses for blockage, replaced fuel filter and spark plugs. To be noted I haven\u2019t had my carbs synched yet. The bike runs okay, the power is there through all the gears at lower rpm\u2019s but my acceleration cuts out and somewhat surges once I hit the top end of the gears. It is also backfiring during deceleration and sometimes having trouble coming down to the base idle. Choke on helps to start bike better but does not run well or better once warm. I\u2019m wondering if I just need the carbs synched or if there\u2019s something else troubling the engine. Any ideas or suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks",
