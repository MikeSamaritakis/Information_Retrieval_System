  "Content": "Hello everyone,\n\nI'm seeking advice for an issue with my 2018 Yamaha Xmax 400, which has clocked 62,000 kilometers.\nRecently, I started experiencing engine \"knocking\" sounds. My mechanic diagnosed it as a failed crankshaft. Consequently, both the crankshaft and piston were replaced. The scooter was picked up from the repair on January 17, 2024, and I was advised to keep it under 80 km/h for the first 1,000 kilometers, which I adhered to.\nEverything seemed fine for the first 466 kilometers, but then I encountered an issue when it was wet and raining; my scooter would shut off when slowing down or nearly stopping, as if the engine was choking.\nThe mechanic initially thought it was a loose connection in the air lifter intake to the engine and fixed it.\nHowever, the problem persisted.\n\nToday, after the plug was replaced, the issue occurred again on my way back home, and this time there was no rain or wet road (see attached video). I'm quite despaired as the repair cost me $2,500.\n\nHas anyone experienced a similar issue or could possibly pinpoint what might be causing this problem?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance for your help!",
