  "Content": "Well, it's that time again! I put a new set of tires on my 2016 at the beginning of the season in 2020. I bought the 2016 new in 2018. I replaced the factory Dunlop's at just over 5000KM with a nice set of Avon Cobra Chromes. The factory Dunlop's were shot with the rear tread worn down and the front cupped. The recommended rear tire is a 240/40R18M/C 79V. I went with a 250/40R18 81V Avon since the 240 wasn't available at the time (COVID shortages). The 250 looks really good on the bike. I ride a lot of two-up and really liked the new tires. The front tire is still good and doesn't need to be replaced. The Avon's have just over 13000KM (8000 miles) on them. I'm not a fan of mixing brands and models between front and back tires so I'll probably go with another Avon since the front is still good.\n\nI am however considering the Metzler Cruisetec model as a replacement. It looks like a decent tire. Has anyone used this tire on their bike?\n\nAre there any other recommendations?\n\nThanks!",
