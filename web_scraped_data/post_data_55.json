  "Content": "I don't want to go too far down the EMP (electro-magnetic-pulse) rabbit hole with this thread, but hope to ferret out what electronic components I (we) would need to restore function to our motorcycles were an EMP to strike them dead.\n\nThe smaller the space between circuit traces, wires or electron paths, the more vulnerable the parts are. Said another way, newer tech, more modern stuff, more sophisticated electronics take less EMP energy than older, clunkier, cruder electronic pathways. Thus Missy's 1978 Honda XL75 (Piglet) is less sensitive than my 2011 BMW F650GS (Jack).\n\nNevertheless, I am wanting to get electrical part spares for Piglet as well as Jack ... not to mention my non-bike power plants.\n\nWith my automobiles, I have local mechanics I think I can trust with the task of prescribing, ordering, supplying and, if necessary, installing the necessary parts. With the bikes, I do not have those resources. Thus I am interested in information I might get from YOU here on this forum.\n\n\n\nOn a related subject, how do I install these things if I have to do it myself?\n\n------\n\nBy the way, I go into more detail, background over here:",
