  "Content": "My KTM Duke 125 (18 plate) wont at all turn on, when i turn the key NOTHING happens, no lights, nothing on the display, and obviously the bike doesn't start. I road to work with absolutely no issues after only 6hrs shift i went to get fuel (i work at Tesco so was a few hundred yrds) absolutely fine. I then filled up with fuel (yes definitely petrol) and it went off once, i turned the key on and off, and it came back then few seconds later it went back off. Also a weird thing is that when it first happened and i hit the bike out of frustration the lights flashed on for a second.\n\nNow i have checked the battery and its fine, even charged it to make sure, have checked the fuses they're all in tact, i have checked all the connections and tried my best to check the ones near the ignition barrel and they all seem fine. There is absolutely no sign of life no matter what i do now. I am assuming it is an electrical problem, maybe something wrong with the ignition barrel or a wire connecting to it.\nAnd no it is not the kill switch.\n\nAny help would be greatly appreciated because i am stumped right now!",
