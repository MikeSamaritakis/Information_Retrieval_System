  "Content": "I haven't take a long motorcycle road trip in several years, but plan on doing one this year, probably in June. I don't camp since my body does not take well to sleeping on the ground anymore. But even with using motels, which I know will be more expensive than ever before, I am reluctant to make advance reservations. Right now I am not at all sure of how many miles I will be riding in a given day. I'll be 81 in June and as I said earlier, have not done this in several years. So my guess is that I will only do about 300 miles before stopping for the night, but plan on riding until I start to feel tired and then will look around for a motel. The advantage of advance reservations would be to not have to worry about finding a place to stay, but it gives up the flexibility of just riding as much as I feel like riding that day.",
