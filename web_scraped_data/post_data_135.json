  "Content": "bought this bike a year ago and rode it a lot last year. put stabil in the tank over winter.\n\nthis spring did not want to start.\n\nprimed the carb and it started and idled fine and would restart quickly after shutting off.\n\ncouple days later went to go for tide and cranked but no start.\n\ndid some internet research and figured fuel pump as this one has the extra wire for starting to the pump I am reading.\n\nput a generic mr gasket fuel pump on and no start. I was getting gas to the carb and had gas in the float bowls when I opened the drains.\n\nWent ahead and bought the factory pump and installed it.\n\nBike started right up ran and idled good. took it for a ride with no issues and good restart.\n\nwent to ride the next day and no start. Cranks but no start. If I can get it to start runs fine and restarts right away.\n\nseems if I leave it over night I get a no start the next day",
