  "Content": "I've been looking into buying a Suzuki Katana (As the parents are nippy about me getting something fast) but in doing my research, I've found that although most of the katanas have the hideous, roundy taillight, often referred to as the \"red Rocket\", some of them do not. Is this an aftermarket part, or do some models come stock like that, and if so, what models come stock? ( I am referring to the early 2000s models)",
