  "Content": "I am going to be riding soon and when i tried starting my bike recently i found that it won't start without the fuel choke pushed on atleast halfway. When it starts and i push the choke off, then it dies. Its been sitting in my dads garage since November. The last time i tried starting it, i didn't have to do that and it wouldn't die every time i turned off the choke.\nCan i fix this myself or do i have to send it to a mechanic or dealer? I need this bike working by this time next month.",
