  "Content": "Hi all,\n\nI am installing some new indicators on my 2000 Honda VTR250. These indicators have a sequential turn on style which given constant power will cycle on and off, because of this I'm keen to bypass the flasher relay such that when I turn my indicator on it provides constant 12V as opposed to the normal on off sequence.\n\nI thought I might just be able to jumper between what I thought was the 12V positive and load pin and leave the earth pin empty but when I tried this, it just turned all the blinkers on when indicating either way. I haven't been able to decipher exactly what the 3 pins are other than the earth nor have I been able to find a usable wiring diagram, that being said I would think it may be similar to similar Honda year models.\n\nHere is a photo of the relay, any ideas would be appreciated.\nThanks",
