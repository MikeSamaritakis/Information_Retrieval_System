  "Content": "What\u2019s up guys. my good friend passed and left us with this bike. I want to finish his build. I am picking up where he left off and it looks like it needs a jackshaft. Problem is i have no clue what model fits, I can\u2019t find one that looks like this with the thin bushings/coupling. I have attached photos. Any response would GREATLY HELP. Things i do know - it has an SS113 serial number AC04548. That\u2019s about it lol. I need to identify both jackstand and the clutch so i can find info on removal/replacement of clutch as well.",
