  "Content": "Hi i'm considering buying a Yamaha MT03 as my first bike. I plan to use it as an everyday bike but I'm having some troubles. What is the rear seat height of the Yamaha MT03 and is there any way i can lower it or make it more comfortable for people in the back? I'm thinking of replacing the stock front seat to thicker one so that both the front and rear seats are leveled. I'm also thinking of lowering the rear seat itself but i don't know if that alters or damages the chassis. Sorry for bad English. Thanks.",
