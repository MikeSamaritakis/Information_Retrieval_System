  "Content": "Okay so I have a 98 virago 535. My issue is that the front cylinder doesn\u2019t fire unless I give it 50% throttle or more. I have replaced plugs coils. Have had compression tested it\u2019s good. It had a single carb conversion before I bought it. On the richer side with the jets.\n\nAnother issue I have is that it won\u2019t stay running unless I\u2019m on the throttle. But I feel like it\u2019s getting enough fuel bc of how rich I have the carb.\n\nthanks",
