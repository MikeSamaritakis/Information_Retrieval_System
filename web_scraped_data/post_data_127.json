  "Content": "This thread is just a rant about my stumpy legs.\n\nI'm not short at 5' 10\" but my 29\" inseam means most riding pants don't fit and most bikes outside of cruisers are too tall!\n\nLast weekend I stopped in at a dealership to check out a bunch of bikes and found out that I can barely reach the ground on most.\n\nGSX-8S... Too tall\nXSR700... Too tall\nMT-07... I could barely do it, but only because the suspension sagged under my weight.\nSV650... I can't flat foot it but I can get the ball of my foot down, so it's doable.\n\nI'd say anything with a seat height greater than 31\" would be a real struggle, almost to the point of being risky. Lowering would be required.",
