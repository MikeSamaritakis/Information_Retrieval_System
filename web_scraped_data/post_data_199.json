  "Content": "Hi, I\u2019ve just recently bought a daystar VL 2012, after riding it 22km to bring it home it was absolutely fine. The next day I took it out for a cruise, then at a set of traffic lights, the clutch went and stalled the bike, after starting it up the clutch wouldn\u2019t engage at all.\n\nI\u2019ve taken the clutch apart and there isn\u2019t any signs of damage and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any reason for the clutch not to function. I\u2019m no mechanic by any means but I know my way around a bike if anyone has any idea please reply to this forum asap. Thankyou!\n\nFor reference here\u2019s a photo with the case off.",
