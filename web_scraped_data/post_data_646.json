  "Content": "Hey folks! I\u2019m a country boy in central WI and a new member here. I don\u2019t really like motorcycles, but will sell anything I can get my hands on including motorcycle related stuff. I do like dirt bikes though. My neighbor/friend bought a new Kawasaki 230R last year. My grandpa has an old blue Honda street bike. I don\u2019t know all the details, so here\u2019s what I do know: him and or his now deceased dad bought it brand new back in the day, they put around 60 miles on it that first summer, it\u2019s been outside tarped ever since, I have no idea why he tarped a brand new bike! He\u2019s only kinda interested in getting it going again next summer.",
