  "Content": "Dear Motorcycle Forum,\n\nSubject: Help with A2 Conversion for My XSR700\n\nHi Yamaha Family,\n\nI'm Eliot, a proud rider of a 2017 Yamaha XSR700, and I've hit a bit of a roadblock. I'm 20 and need to fit my bike with an A2 restrictor kit to keep it street-legal for my age here in Iceland.\n\nI've heard that Yamaha dealerships usually have these kits ready to go, but it looks like I'm out of luck locally. My question is, could I get one shipped over here and take care of the installation and paperwork myself? Or do I have to contact Yamaha Europe and get their approval and have them send a kit to Iceland? If so what are Yamaha Europes\n\u2019s contacts and would they actually be willing to help? I'd really appreciate some pointers on how to make this happen.\n\nThe local advice has been a bit wishy-washy, and while I could wait until next August to upgrade my license for an unrestricted A bike, I'm super keen to enjoy my XSR700 this season rather than watching it collect dust.\n\nAny advice, alternative ideas, or contacts would be amazing. I'm all ears for any suggestions that could help me ride legally before the summer's out.\n\nThanks a ton for any help you can give!\n\nCheers,\n\nEliot\nP.S. Here is a pic of my bike",
