  "Content": "I currently ride a Rebel 500 SE and for a starting bike it has done an excellent job of teaching me. The little 500 has also been an \"ok\" commuter but as the weather gets better and I commute more, it's shortcomings are becoming clear. The power, range, and suspension are a bit lacking for my 88 mile daily commute (almost entirely highway at 60-65 mph).\n\nSo, I've found myself looking at the Yamaha XSR700 and the Suzuki SV650. Both of these bikes should give me an increased range and hopefully a more comfortable ride while still getting 50+ MPG. I plan to try and find examples locally to look at them in person but I figured I would ask here as well. I'm heavily leaning towards the SV650... mostly because it's less expensive.",
