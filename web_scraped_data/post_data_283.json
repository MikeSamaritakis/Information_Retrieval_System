  "Content": "Hi everyone,\n\nI never cared about motorcycles until a couple of years ago after I turned 40. I don't know why, but suddenly I wanted a motorcycle. Here in EU we can do a 6 hour course to get A1 license (provided you already have a car license) which allows up to 125cc bikes. So, I did that last year and bought a Yamaha XSR 125. Just to see if this is something I would actually like. Unfortunately I had a leg surgery shortly after buying the bike so I did only 3500 km so far, but I really like riding. I will be getting a full license this year and buy a bigger bike (probably next year).\n\nCheers!",
