  "Content": "Hi, I bought a Suzuki GS 550 E and I am now realizing that I have bought a dud.\nThe frame, brake, wheels etc are all good, just the engine that is giving never ending problems.\nMy question is, has anybody here removed the engine and done an electric conversion?\nAny guides or advice you can offer?\nDoes not have to go fast and have a range of around 80-100 miles.\n\nThanks",
