  "Content": "My son bought a 2017 Aprillia motorcycle 39 days ago. Engine froze up, thankfully he\u2019s okay, but the cost of the repair is more than the value of the motorcycle. Torque warranty is saying they won\u2019t pay for it because of that. He\u2019s contacted the dealer and they\u2019ve not called him back, yet. Is there any recourse? He bought the motorcycle \u201cas is\u201d but bought a warrant hoping if anything went wrong he\u2019d be covered. 🤦🏻\u200d♀️",
