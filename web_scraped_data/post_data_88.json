  "Content": "Looked at an Aprilla 50cc today. It passed mot 2 days ago. But today when I went to purchase it wouldnt start. Turned out no fuel.\n\nFuelled up but wouldn't start after multiple attempts till battery exhausted. Tried with a jump start but no joy. Seller later checked plug - No spark at plug but power going to ht lead (he will change the plug tomorrow).\n\nI didnt see the plug so don't know if fouled or overheated or snapped electrode.\n\nQuestion is.... If it starts normally first time and passed an MOT 2 days ago (9k on clock, 2008). If. It just a crappy plug and poor battery. Battery was a cheepo not gel. What could have happened? And if a plug change makes it start and I reckon it should, what may be causing the plug to fail.\n\nMy thoughts are related to a cheepo battery, maybe overheating it even bad luck.\n\nAsi can't strip the moped (because it's not mine yet) do you have any advice. Could it be caused by a catastrofic failure?\n\nIf oil is getting into combustion chamber, how could I tell and what could I do about it?\n\nCheers",
