  "Content": "I currently have a 7 year old schuberth c3 and it\u2019s time to get something new. I want to keep things under $300 and want a full face, not a modular. I\u2019ve narrowed my choices down some and want to hear some opinions from owners who have used them. I\u2019m split between a scorpion t520, scorpion covert fx, and a scorpion 1400. The 1400 is from Chromeburners so I\u2019m hesitant to order it since it\u2019s outside the US.\n\nprice comparison- t520 $170\ncovert fix $212\n1400 $201\n\nThoughts and opinions welcome",
