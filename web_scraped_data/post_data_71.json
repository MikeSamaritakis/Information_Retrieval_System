  "Content": "I have had this bike for two months and it has ran great, I recently put on a aftermarket exhaust and rejeted the carbs with Dynojets stage 2 jet kit. But now I can\u2019t get the bike to run right going down the road. Above around quarter throttle it starts to stutter and if you push it more of course it bogs. I\u2019m pretty sure it\u2019s a fuel issue but am not positive. Any insight would be appreciated.",
