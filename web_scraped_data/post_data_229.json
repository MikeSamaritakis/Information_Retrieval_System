  "Content": "Hi guys, I\u2019ve recently purchased a Honda CBF 125 (2010). It had about 20,000 miles it was in good condition and worked perfectly fine.\n\nUnfortunately I dropped the bike exiting a junction at around 5-10 MPH. This resulted in the front brake lever snapping in half and the front right indicator smashing, including the bulb. Apart from the broken indicator the bike still worked fine.\n\nLater that day I\u2019d started the bike up again and noticed that the neutral light wasn\u2019t working. Upon further inspection I\u2019d realised that now none of the indicators would turn on, the horn wasn\u2019t working, the brake light worked but didn\u2019t get brighter when the brakes were activated and the engine light which would come on as you turn the key to on no longer worked.\n\nThe bike is completely dead electronically until I start it. It still starts and runs fine. The brake lights still turn on and the headlight works. This is my first manual motorbike and my knowledge on repairs especially electronically is very limited so if anyone has any idea what the problem could be please let me know.\n\nSide note: before I\u2019d dropped the bike as I\u2019d turn the key to the on position the bike would make a whirring sound (I think this has something to do with the bike charging system). As I turn the key to the on position I no longer hear that sound.",
