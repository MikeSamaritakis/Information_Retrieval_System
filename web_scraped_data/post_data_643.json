  "Content": "The starter on my '82 Sportster worked perfectly yesterday. Today I turned on the ignition, everything lit up, the battery was fully charged, but when I depressed the start button the starter didn't work at all, or even make a clicking noise. I noticed a noise under the seat, so I took the seat off and found that the starter relay was making noise and vibrating every time I depressed the start button.\nThe relay is the original one from '82. I ordered a new one. I know nothing about electronics. Does it sound like the relay is bad? I hope that's the case. It's an inexpensive part.\nThanks!",
