  "Content": "Hey guys. I\u2019m brand new. No! I\u2019m not even brand new\u2026. I\u2019ve never ridden a motorcycle before and I\u2019m almost 50.\n\nI\u2019ve been on bicycles for a long time. I\u2019ll do long 60 mile road cycling adventures and enjoy black diamond mountain bike trails, even if I\u2019m not the most aggressive.\nI LOVE biking.\nFor years now, I\u2019ve wanted to step that love of bikes up to motorcycles but\u2026. I\u2019ve always decided against it because of the lack of safety.\nNow, I\u2019m ready to take that step. I want to get a bike. I\u2019m thinking along the lines of an adventure bike like a KTM or BMW or something but, in all honesty, would likely end up using it more for my long freeway commute and some open country asphalt rides on days off. So\u2026 cruiser, adventure bike, eventually touring bike\u2026. Definitely not sport bike. (Not interested in racing.)\n\nim TALL. 6\u20195\u201d\n\nok so, I am ready to start getting into it but\u2026.. as I\u2019ve said, I\u2019ve only SAT on a motorcycle once or twice in my life, never ridden one. In order to get started, I need to go over the most basic practices you could imagine.\nSo my question is\u2026. How can I do this? I can\u2019t test ride a bike at a dealer (or private seller) without having sole basic practice under my belt. I can\u2019t pick up a cheap used beater if I don\u2019t know how to ride it home lol.\nSo where can I go to start this process? Are there used dealers that would deal with a person with my total lack of experience?\nAre there classes that provide bikes to learn on?\n\nthanks in advance. Don\u2019t judge me! ðŸ˜‚",
