  "Content": "Hi,\nI'm Harry. I haven't been here in awhile I own an 81 CB900C, an 83 CB1000C, and an 03 VTX 1300. I've owned my 81 CB900C since 1986 or 38 years. I love this bike, but it's been misbehaving for about 3 motorcycle seasons now. I am bound and determined to get it roadworth again.\nThanks.",
