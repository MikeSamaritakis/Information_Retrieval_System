  "Content": "I live in a state with a helmet law.\n\nAlways wore a helmet: either a 3/4 or a full face, over five years of riding probably totaling 5000 miles now.\n\nI'm not terribly far from South Carolina which I understand does not have any helmet law. The last time I rode a motorcycle in the Palmetto State I saw about 1/4 of the bikers there with nothing protective on their heads.\n\n\nI'd like to try it just to see what it feels like to have the wind in my hair.\n\nI am a little bit worried about my prescription eyeglasses though-- will they get blown off my face if I turn my head to look over my shoulder? Will they vibrate and shake even when facing directly forward?",
