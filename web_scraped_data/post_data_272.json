  "Content": "It looks like Kawasaki is replacing the 400 with the 500. What is interesting is the 500 is a couple hundred dollars less (CDN) than the 400. The 500's is 52cc larger but only produces about 2 more HP. Personally, I like the looks of the 400 better than the 500.\n\nAny thoughts on the change?\n\n\n\n\nZ400 2023 NINJA 400 KRT EDITION Motorcycle | Canadian Kawasaki Motors Inc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nZ500 2024 Z500 Motorcycle | Canadian Kawasaki Motors Inc.",
