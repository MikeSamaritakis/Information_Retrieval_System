  "Content": "My 7-year Yamaha Bolt is still on its original tires with 6k miles on them. Both have plenty of tread left. The rear tire is in great shape, while the front tire has some cracks on the side wall and the tread too. It did pass the state inspection last year. Just wonder if it\u2019s still safe to ride on them or it\u2019s time to replace them? I plan to sell it and upgrade to a new bike later this year. If they are still safe to ride I could save several hundred bucks when selling it. What do you think? Thanks.",
