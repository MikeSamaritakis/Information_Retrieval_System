  "Content": "Hi all, I'm Jack from near London England. I have a very long history of riding many bikes since I was 16 and I,m now in my late 70's. I still enjoy the buzz of my Honda X ADV750. A new experience in biking for me, DCT gearbox and no clutch but it keeps me riding as my old Triumph Trophy 1200 just got too heavy. I have had all sorts of bikes including Pans, Goldwings and Crosstourers. Looking forward to reading your stories. Ride SAFE all.",
