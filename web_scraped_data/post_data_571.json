  "Content": "Hey there folks, first time rider here\n\nGot myself an RF600 '93 a month ago and I'm really enjoying it, but the DEVIL RACING exhaust it came with is too loud and I keep waking gramps every time I get home. I've been looking at some options and I'm thinking of trying out a BLACK WIDOW muffler.\nThing is, I'm not sure how easy it's going to be to fit it on the bike. The BW has options for the GSF Bandit of around the same time, and I'm under the impression that might be my best bet to get it to fit.\n\nAny advice about fitting slip-ons on bikes that don't appear in the compatible list? Anyone know if the Bandit and RF platform can interchange exhausts?\n\nCheers and ride safe",
