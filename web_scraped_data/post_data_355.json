  "Content": "Hello! I\u2019m new to this forum and still generally new to bikes so I\u2019m scratching my head pretty hard with this issue I\u2019ve been having lately. I got an ECU flash from Norton a while ago because I bought an R3 with a full Akro exhaust but for some reason, the bike doesn\u2019t start with the flash. Bought a stock ECU to see if it\u2019ll start again and it does. As I wait to hear back from Norton on getting the tune checked, what are some other possible issues that could be causing this? I want to make sure I\u2019m not overlooking the simple things. Thanks!",
