  "Content": "Most of the time I just feel like going for a ride. Just to have the experience of being out in the elements on my bike, even if it is just riding on very familiar roads for an hour and then returning home. But some days that doesn't seem like enough to motivate me to get the bike out of the garage. I feel like I need a destination.\n\nWhen my wife rides as my passenger, we often go for lunch with a ride of an hour or two hours, then a leisurely lunch, then an hour or two hours ride home. That makes for an almost perfect day for me. But going for lunch has less appeal if I am riding alone. Sometimes I decide to run an unnecessary errand to a location a half hour or more away, just to have a destination to head to.\n\nMotorcycling has been such a major factor in my life for so long that it sort of scares me to think about what I would do if at some point I am just not motivated to ride at all. But not today. Its supposed to be clear skies and about 75 degrees this afternoon, albeit with windy conditions, and even if I just stick to local roads I'm looking forward to getting out on one of my bikes.\n\nJust a Sunday morning musing.",
