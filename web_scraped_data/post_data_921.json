  "Content": "I have a 125 ttr 2008 which I can\u2019t get started. It was running fine 3 years ago but took it out of the garage to get it running again a few weeks ago and can\u2019t get it started. So far I have done the following: 1) replaced the gas with new gas 2) replaced the carburetor 3) changed the spark plug It still won\u2019t start. It turns over just fine but won\u2019t start. Any recs on what to do next?",
