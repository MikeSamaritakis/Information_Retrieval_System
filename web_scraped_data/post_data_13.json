Look to sell it asap since im no longer able to keep it since im downsizing and no longer have room. Kids were playing on the bike and cracked the odometer. Frame pucks have some sxs from storage. No accidents and clean title in hand. Reach out and give me your best offers. Thank you. 201-509-7387 or chris.lopes84@gmail.com",
