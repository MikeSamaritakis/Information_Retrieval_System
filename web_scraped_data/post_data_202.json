  "Content": "Hi everyone I am new here. I would like to fit larger profile tyres equivalent to a 14 inch or more tyre wheel to a 13 inch wheel as the bike I am getting has a lower seat height and I would like to match the Honda forza. I know you can do this with bicycle 24 and 700c wheels as in fit bigger tyres!, Does anyone have any experience of this or would know?",
