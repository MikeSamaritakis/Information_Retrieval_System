  "Content": "So, I don't know if it's a stator or battery issue, but cold starting my bike, is has a slow crank. Once it warms up, it's better, but still not as fast as it should be. I hook up my battery charger, and it has a fast crank. The battery is new, but the previous owner kept the bike outside. So, I don't know if it messed up the stator. I have also been thinking it might need the carbs tuned. I haven't tested the voltage to the battery with everything off and running. I can give updates when I get that done, but and advice would be much appreciated.",
