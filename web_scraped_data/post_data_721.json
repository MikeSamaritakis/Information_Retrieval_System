  "Content": "I have a 2023 KLX300. I noticed when i first put it in gear with the clutch in, the bike jerks forward just a bit as if the clutch was not in. I noticed this after changing the brake and clutch levers so i was playing with the adjustments. I believe the clutch is adjusted properly and it runs fine. Also if i start it with it in gear and the clutch in, the bike jerks forward just a bit.\n\nI'm guessing this is just how the clutch and transmission works on this bike and i bet it is normal. I don't know much about bike mechanics. After it's running the clutch seems to be working as expected.\n\nIs it normal for a bike to jerk forward just a bit when it's goes from neutral to first gear with the clutch lever fully in?",
