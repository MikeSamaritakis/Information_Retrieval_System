  "Content": "Fraziers H-D had a demo ride day. I was in the last group of riders. I didn't have any particular model in mind to try, so I said to set me up with something \"one step up\" from the two other cruisers I've owned: A Harley Sportster 883 and a Honda Shadow 1100.\n\nThey put me on this 117 cubic inch low rider. And this thing is LOW. The seat's only something like 26\" high.\nIt felt like I was straddling an 100 cc dirt bike.\nBut it was powerful. Quick. Smooth shifting on the 6- speed manual.\nHowever, the \"mid position foot controls\" were still too cramped for me, given the seat height.\nI think I'd prefer to have the seat 2\" taller, and maybe THEN the controls would be in the right position to not have my hips and knees so bent all the time.\n\nOh, and the mirrors were too close to the bike's centerline. They need to be extended outward more, so I can see past my own shoulders.\n\nThe bike felt light, but according to the sticker on it, it weighs 680 lbs.\nI would have guessed around 550! The center of gravity is low. And that really helps for stability.",
