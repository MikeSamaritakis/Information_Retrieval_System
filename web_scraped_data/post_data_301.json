  "Content": "I recently purchased this 97 thundercat from some random guy on Facebook. Dude said the bike can start on starting fluid but definitely can\u2019t. I\u2019ve replaced the stator, pickup coil, CDI. I\u2019ve checked all the fuses, and continuity on the wires at the coils. I\u2019m getting 12v at the coil then when I turn the bike over it\u2019ll drop down to 8 6 0 back up to 8 but I\u2019m getting zero volts at the end of the spark wire. No idea what it could be and it\u2019s irritating me to the fullest extent ðŸ˜­",
