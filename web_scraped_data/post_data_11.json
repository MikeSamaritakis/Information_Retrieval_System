  "Content": "I have a 2006 KX450 that I've trying to get running for 8 months. When I kick it, it just turns the engine over and doesn't ignite. On occasion it'll backfire extremely loudly.\n\nI've cleaned and checked the Carb, replaced the CDI and Ignition coil, checked valves (.007 and .008 on exhaust, .004 and .005 on intake valves), and a full top end.\n\nThe two mechanics I've taken it to haven't been super helpful. One said \"the bottom end is ****ed\" after trying to kick it over a couple times and the other said \"tried to start unit and the engine is very tight meaning it feels like the engine is binding and isn't spinning freely\".\n\nI've taken out the engine and removed the side covers. The engine seems to spin very freely and I can't find any binding or such in the bottom end. The kick-start catches every 3rd or 4th kick, but the auto-decompression seems to be working fine.\n\nI'm very close to just buying a new engine so any advise would be helpful.",
