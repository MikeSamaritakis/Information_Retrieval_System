  "Content": "Said community/group doesn't exist yet. Just trying to get a feel for how many riders might take interest in it. I imagine it would be riders who also enjoy reading/literature/learning/growing/etc. The meetup spot would be a local Barnes & Noble or public library. Not sure yet as to what would all go on there but let me know what your opinions are, no wrong answers",
