  "Content": "Hi I have had to take my scooter to a garage for them to do this but I did manage to get one of the rusty buggers out and I am thinking as a last resort of implementing an old screw driver into a mini crow bar by cutting a V shaped groove into the end of the flat blade and trying to pry them out I do not want to drill as that has not always gone well.\nAny words of advice or tips and tricks someone may know of as I was thinking of using a kitchen fork but some of the screws are counter sunk! Even using a Swiss Army knife or tool to pull them out, I need to get to some side panel screw behind them which involves getting the other panels off.\n\nCheers in advance",
