  "Content": "Prior to today my wife had stuck to backroads, with the exception of a 6 mile stint in traffic.\nPrior to two days ago it was not uncommon for her to go 5 MPH under the speed limit on straight roads.\nTwo days ago we rode to a park on backroads, which was a 28 mile round trip; she finally went the speed limit and I could see her confidence on the motorcycle growing. When we got home she said she wanted to ride the motorcycles to lunch on Friday; surprisingly, she picked a restaurant she likes a little distance from here.\n\nToday was the day, 21 miles (45 minutes in traffic) one way to a restaurant by the water.\nThe weather was sunny and 70 degrees, perfect.\nWe had smoked fish dip appetizer and split a fried seafood platter, tasty.\nThe outing was fun and my wife's motorcycle riding & confidence continues to improve.",
