  "Content": "I have a street triple rs that's been brilliant for the last 3 years but recently it's started to run very rough, when I first start off until it gets warmed up and it seems to improve. The exhaust is making a chugging kind of sound, occasionally i can smell a faint burning and also a tappetity sound l, I had the valves checked about 500 miles ago and all were within tolerance, any ideas would be appreciated as.ita driving me mad now, ive changed the spark plugs, air filter and battery but no difference at all.",
