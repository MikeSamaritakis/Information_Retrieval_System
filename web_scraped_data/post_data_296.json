  "Content": "I purchased what I mistakenly thought was a complete K10 Corsair 66 68 68 front wheel on eBay. Turns out, it\u2019s not complete. No brake plate, no axle. The axle isn\u2019t a big deal, but I\u2019m looking at brake plates and there is a 1967 K11P front brake plate for a reasonable price. I reached out to the seller of the wheel to see if they\u2019re willing to do anything to help make this right because the brake plate is pictured and I messaged before I bought it and they told me everything pictured was included. However, on the off chance they don\u2019t do anything to help, will the K11 brake plate fit the K10 wheel?",
