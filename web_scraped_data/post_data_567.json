  "Content": "Yesterday I read a news article about Ann Margaret still riding her Harley at 82 (Ann, not the Harley). I think that's great, and she was also great in my eyes (especially because of her commitment to those of us in the military) but I don't really think it is that remarkable that she is still riding. I'm almost 81 and ride and hope to be doing so for many more years. After my ride yesterday I stopped to fill up the 3 gallon gas tank on my new Royal Enfield Hunter 350 when a older gentleman in motorcycle clothing came around the gas pump to look at my bike. He assumed it was an old vintage British bike when he saw the RE logo, and seemed surprised when I told him that it is now an Indian company and that the bike was brand new. Since he looked even older than me I had to ask him how old he is and what was he riding. He was on a 2023 Harley cruiser (pretty bike, for sure) and told me that he is 86! I told him that he's my new hero, and wished him a safe ride.\n\nMaybe years ago there weren't so many older riders. I have met many who told me that they had been riders but had given it up due to age and physical issues, and often the person saying this was much, much younger than I am. Maybe its the result of modern medicine that people my age can still comfortably ride motorcycles even if they, like me, gave up a really heavy bike and went to something lighter.\n\nSo I still like Ann Margaret, and I'm glad she's riding, but I don't think its really that special.",
