  "Content": "Updated 2/15/2024 below / Solved!\n\nLong time/long ago rider returning to the sport.\nMy new bike has a well-known turbulence problem with the windscreen. Am addressing that separately.\nIn the meantime, am dealing with it using earplugs which always use anyway.\nFull face Shoei RF1400 type.\nWas using silicone tiered plugs that were ok, but then switched to foam due to the increased decibel rating.\nYikes! They actually AMPLIFIED the wind, turbulence, and even engine sound. I road for about 30 minutes and had to keep ducking lower behind the screen to reduce the pain of the roar and popping. I didn\u2019t understand why this was happening. Thought I hadn\u2019t inserted them correctly, and pulled over a couple times to reinstall. \u2014have been a rider and previous firearms dealer for many years, so I\u2019ve stuck in a few earplugs.\nNever had this issue before. It was so bad that I finally had to pull over and go back to silicone, but not before causing lingering ear pressure sensation and still ringing 2 days later.\nSo my question is: What the hell?",
