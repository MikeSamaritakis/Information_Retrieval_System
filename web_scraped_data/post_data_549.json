  "Content": "I was riding up the road to get to work and I was coming up to a junction so I started to go down the gears but when I went from 3rd to 2nd my bike displayed that I wasn't in a gear, not even neutral and then the screen flashed a few times before shutting off and now my bike wont turn on at all. I checked my battery and it doesn't seem like anything is out of place but I don't want to poked and prod without a little guidance as I don't know what I am doing.\n\n\nThe bike is a 2023 gsx125s.",
