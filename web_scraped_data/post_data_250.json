  "Content": "I recently came into a 2008 boulevard c90. They guy before me had the bike straight pipes and the PAIR system removed. Now I don't mind the bike being as loud as it is but the backfire is irritating and I'm sure it's not running as good as it should. When asked about the backfire he said \"he put a metal plate with nuts on the bike to stop it and it must have rattled off\" I assumed he meant a AIS block plate. Now my question is. How do I go about fixing this, put on the missing AIS block plate? Can I return the bike to stock and put the PAIR system back on? Or are there other aftermarket option I can opt for? I will attach pictures below. Thanks in advance and please excuse my ignorance in the subject.",
