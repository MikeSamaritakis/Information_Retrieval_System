  "Content": "Hey there,\n\nI bought my first bike brand new in May of 2022. Got two year tags on it and that\u2019s going to expire this year. This might seem like a dumb question, but is renewing the tags for it the same as a vehicle? Every year an inspection has to be done and then present that at the DMV to get newer tags for the license plate? I\u2019ve heard different things like \u201cYou have five years till you have to do an inspection for the bike to get new tags since you bought it brand new\u201d etc. Just curious and still learning a lot about riding, maintenance, cosmetics on the bike, and great gear to buy when riding.\n\nThank you!",
