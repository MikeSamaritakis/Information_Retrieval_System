  "Content": "Hi,\nThe speedometer on my Kawasaki has been acting up for quite a while. It sometimes jumps all over the place never showing a correct or clear speed but most of the times it shows zero. This bike uses the ABS sensors to measure speed! I've measured both sensors, which show the same resistance. Replaced the rear one which didn't change anything.\nWhat i've figured out is that if i unplug the front sensor, drive a few meters and then plug it back in it works fine as long as the ignition doesn't turn off for more than a few seconds. I will try to ride for an extended time tomorrow to rule out bad connections as the problem. Seeing as the bike clearly knows the speed, but refuses to display it to me (and doesn't count towards the odometer) i'm thinking it's a ECU fault, but i have minimal experience with those parts of a bike. Would love opinions and possible solutions, or more ways to troubleshoot, things to check for!\nBike is 2020 Z125 (not pro version)\nThanks!\n\nDifferent sensor combinations:\nFront only, works if unplugged and replugged if ignition is on. ABS light\nBoth plugged, no speed\nRear only, no speed, ABS light\nBoth unplugged, no speed, ABS light, engine light",
