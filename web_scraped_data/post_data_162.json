  "Content": "Hi there! I'm looking into learning how to ride a motorcycle and am planning to take an MSF course soon. My issue is that I am a 6'5\" guy and I understand that might limit my options a bit. I've been looking at \"beginner friendly\" sport bikes, and had my eyes on a Ninja 400 or a R3. I went to the dealership and sat on some bikes, but the guy there kinda had me sold on a Ninja 650 since I wouldn't get bored of it as quickly. Not sure how much of that was just him hoping to make an easy sell, though...\n\nAny advice would be great! Tips or habits to avoid is what I'm here for.",
