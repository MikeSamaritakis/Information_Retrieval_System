This is a 212cc predator engine on an American made Schwinn bicycle frame, with Suzuki K10 motorcycle forks, a long moped seat, and currently moped rims but I\u2019m upgrading the front wheel to a Suzuki rim with 110mm drum. It\u2019s also got a charging flywheel and stator, complete lighting and horn system. It\u2019s got a variable speed belt transmission, and it\u2019s geared to go 60 but I\u2019m still working on tuning the carb. Replacing the rear brake shoes tonight and might be able to get a test ride in if the weather holds.",
