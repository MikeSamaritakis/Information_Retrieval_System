  "Content": "This is the title to a book, first published in 1997 by Melissa Holbrook Pierson. Anyone who loves riding a motorcycle will find much to like in this short (237 pages) book, and might help those who do not ride better understand what is so very special about riding a motorcycle. I highly recommend it. I know it is available from Amazon, and might even be found at a well stocked library. A bit dated in some of its references, but still a worthwhile read.",
