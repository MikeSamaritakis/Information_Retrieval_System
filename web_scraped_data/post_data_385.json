  "Content": "2002 Suzuki GSF 1200 Bandit\n\nProblem:\nDelayed power / lights when key is turned in ignition + will not try to start.\n\nHistory:\nPurchased bike February 2024 and it has been running like a top. No problems until 03/20/2024. I'm a newer rider so the bike has been ridden easy; short rides daily and some parking lot practice.\n\nProblem Details:\nWe arrived home from a 20mi ride then decided to run into town to get gas. Bike was shut off for less than 5 minutes. Turned the key, lights came on as normal, hit the start, relay clicked and all lights immediately shut off / no power.\n\nCurrently it takes about 30 seconds after turning the key for lights to come on and dials to activate. Lights will stay on, but as soon as you hit start everything instantly dies. Relay clicks, but bike does not try to start.\n\nObservations:\nWe haven't had the time to take anything apart yet, and are hoping to dig into it tomorrow. So far what we've looked at is...\nBattery is 12.3V\nVoltage is 12.3 from battery to relay (tried replacing 30 amp fuse, no change).\n\nHas anyone had experience with this or know if this is a common issue with the ~2002 Bandit? Any suggestions welcome. Thanks.",
