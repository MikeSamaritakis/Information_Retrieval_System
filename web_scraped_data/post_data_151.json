  "Content": "On my short list for this summer's Must Do is rolling on AMA members number one ranked road, The Beartooth Highway.\nHow could I live this close and not check it out?\n\nI don't find events, crowds and such attractive, but I do find myself at least paying attention to the July 18-21 Beartooth Rally.\nIncluded in the big weekend are poker runs over awesome roads, show, vendors, camping, iron-horse rodeo, bikes and bikers.\n\nMy view at this moment is that the highway rather than being uncluttered with great freedom of movement could be abnormally crowded during that time. I might be better off getting my ride on it done well before the rally.\n\nOf course that does not preclude doing both. I suspect this might be like a Sturgis stepchild that should be experienced at least once per lifetime.",
