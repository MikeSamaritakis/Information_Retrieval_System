  "Content": "I'm planning on taking a motorcycle road trip in late Spring or early summer, by myself and with no specific time limit to be away from home. I'm getting older, and will be turning 81 about the time I can leave, and feel like this well might be the last such trip I will get to make. I plan on heading west from where I live in Rockford, IL and get at least as far as the Black Hills area in South Dakota, visiting Crazy Horse, Mt. Rushmore, the Badlands and maybe Devils Tower in Wyoming.\n\nMy question for anyone who knows this route is, would it be a good ride to just take U.S. 20 straight west until mid Nebraska, then head north to the Black Hills. I really don't want to use the Interstates, but not sure that U.S. 20 would be any more scenic or interesting. Options would be to either head north into Minnessotta before heading West, or south and then come across Iowa and into Nebraska before heading north. But again, I would prefer to avoid the Interstates.\n\nAny suggestions or advice? I had hoped to have some company for the trip but my old riding friends are either dead, given up riding or just not up to a long road trip.",
