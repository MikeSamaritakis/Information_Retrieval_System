  "Content": "The bikes a 2017 husqvarna fe250. The steering lock was engaged when the bike mysteriously tipped over busting the steering lock mechanism. I did a bit of research and seems like KTM uses the same system and the basics apply to all bikes. The key still turns the locking cylinder and the handlebars turn freely. I want to repair or replace the steering lock. There\u2019s nothing in the owners manual and nothing comprehensive online on how to remove or repair. I\u2019m inquiring if anyone knows\n1) can it be easily repaired or replaced with basic tools\n2) can I get a replacement that works with my ignition key oem\n3) is it dangerous to ride with potential for steering to lock up\n4) should I bring it to the motorcycle mechanic and stop trying to screw with it\n\nAny insight is appreciated thanks!",
