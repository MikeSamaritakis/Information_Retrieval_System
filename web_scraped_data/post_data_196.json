  "Content": "Hi guys, my 2015 cb125f 22000 miles makes a racket, sound clip attached.\nBike was noisy when I bought it, removed valve cover, one of the roller cam followers had destroyed its needles, I replaced rockers & camshaft including new o ring, drained old oil. Started 1st kick. Still noisy. Any ideas\nI have removed barrel & piston to check big end vertical movement, no discernable movement, small end seems ok. I'm stumped what to do next.\nWondering about oil pump, it does work but how well ?\nAudio file",
