  "Content": "Things ive tried:\n\nUsing normal seat (makes crotch numb)\n\nCarving the seat (can't carve straight)\n\nSeatconcepts (causes sit bone pain that goes to my legs, and yes I gave time for it to break in)\n\nSeatconcepts + Coleman maddog (same thing with sit bone pain but less)\n\nRubber mesh thingy (Good, but slightly numb)\n\nAnd I'm already a cyclist (20 mile trips) and the reason my road bike seat is from a cruiser is because of sit bone issues.\n\nMy only guess right now is to maybe find a way to mount a rebel 250 seat onto it as I had no issue with that\n\nSo stock seat foam density is good but formed wrong + makes me sit too high despite being a tall rider\n\nI am not in a position right now to spend $500 on a seat right now and I feel robbed with spending $350 on the seatconcepts (this was well before I knew they would take it back if two weeks didnt work)",
