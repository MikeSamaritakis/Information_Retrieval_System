  "Content": "Hi,\n\nI have a sym symphony cbs scooter.\nToday I was heading into work when the engie light came on. I thought as I'm close to work I will carry on and park at work. When I was accelerating it feel like it was skipping almost losing power a little bit.\n\nHas anyone got any ideas I'm new to this and this is my 1st scooter so any information I'd appreciate. Thank you",
