  "Content": "This is for a 98 Kawasaki ninja zx6r. With 80000 kilometres.\nThere was always a rattling noise coming from the area where the clutch is especially at 5-6k rpm. It stops almost immediately when I pull it in.\nBut when i was riding on the highway all of a sudden the noise became really bad and I lost quite a bit of power. It still worked but now it sounds like a diesel tractor when i start it.\n\n\n\nit isnt the plates themselves because it makes the noise with them removed aswell. Could it be the damping springs or the bearing?",
