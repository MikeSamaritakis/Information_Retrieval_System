  "Content": "The only light on the back of the Goldwing that I never converted\nto LED was the license plate light. So I got an LED for that one.\nShould be simple, right?\nAfter nearly twisting my neck upside down with a flashlight,\nI found that the license plate lens was held in with two tiny\nphillips screws. Easy peasy!\nThe plate sits in a recess in the back of the fender with the light\nabove it. Turns out that there is no room to get a standard handle\nscrewdriver in there. Only a stubby would fit. And then....\nBoth of those screws were so effin' tight that I damned near mangled\nthe screws and my fingers trying to work in that tiny space.\nTook forever to get them out...a small fraction of a turn at a time.\nAnd THEN...the bulb does not push UP into the housing. The socket\nis mounted sideways. You can't get normal human fingers in there\nto grab the bulb. I ended up using TWO index fingers to grab it and\nwiggle it back and forth a dozen times in order to\npull it out. And same kind of contortions to put the new bulb back in.\nAnd of course the screws would not go in easily even though they are\njust screwing into the plastic housing. I had to grease the screws with\nVaseline to get them to go back in.\nWhat should have been a ten minute job ended up being nearly\nan hour.\nI wanna get a hold of the little Japanese guy who designed that\nlight housing and strangle him!",
