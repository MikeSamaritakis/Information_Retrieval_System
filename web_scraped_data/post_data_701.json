I made a right hand turn. And it started acting up. Like it was cutting off and on. It did this the rest of the way home. I haven't been able to get it running yet. It turns my battery charger off. When I turn on the switch! Can someone pls help me with this? I have pulled all the fuses and it is still doing it.",
