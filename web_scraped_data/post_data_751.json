  "Content": "Hello, I\u2019ve had my bike on standby for about a year. It had an oil pan leak and faulty petcock valve. Just had a chance to fix it. But now the carb started leaking gas on carb 1 & 2, probably from just sitting there and gas gunk. Decided to rebuild the carbs. I bought a rebuild kit off ebay, and found a piece that I cant seem to find where to put. I\u2019m no mechanic. Try to fix things here and there mostly off videos or shop manuals. Does anyone how what it is?",
