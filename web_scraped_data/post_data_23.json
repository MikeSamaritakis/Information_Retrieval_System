  "Content": "Hello everyone. I recently got a 82' CB650 Classic and put some work into it. I have had the carbs rebuilt, new battery, new stator, new fuses, new spark plugs, valve adjustments, new tires, new petcock, air filter, and a few other things non related to operability. Since changing the stator I have had issues with it starting. When initially swapping the old stator out it started right up, but when I went to give it some gas it putters out and dies. I previously thought that this was a stator problem, not giving enough elec to the plugs. Someone else told method the polarity might be reversed so I swapped the black and white wires on the stator, but to no avail. Now that I have changed the stator it makes me think something else is up. The rectifier has been checked, and is in working order. Maybe the rotor itself has been demagnetized somehow? I dontknow what to do next and was hoping for some help before taking it to a local shop and spending more money I don't have. If anyone has any info it would be much appreciated! thanks",
