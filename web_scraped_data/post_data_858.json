  "Content": "This is a '96 Yamaha Virago xv535 for sale a few hours from me with less than 3K miles and has been in climate-controlled storage. It seems these are fairly rare to find un-trashed. The owner says that it runs great, has no leaks, rust or issues. That remains to be seen until I SEE IT.\n\nI've read great reviews about the bike. I'm not concerned that it's more of a starter bike, but for old me, that's okay. The bike will achieve over 90mph top speed and cruise easily at 70 or more.\n\nOwner wants $2,900. for it. Seems reasonable. Thoughts???\n\nOh yeah...Happy New Year!",
