  "Content": "Does anyone else have this problem?\n\nMy small town has become so inundated with transplants from EVERYWHERE, that for the first time in my long life, I feel as if it's too dangerous to ride. People who come here drive far too fast and angry, tailgating, passing on corners, and slamming into many, rear-ending others at lights and stop signs because they are either under the influence of alcohol and drugs, or have their eyes and fingers on their cell phones. We have auto and MC deaths almost weekly, and we are a town of around 12K is all.\n\nI say \"Trapped\" because I live on the Olympic Peninsula in WA state, and almost no country roads that go any distance. The Olympics on one side and beaches on the other. The main highway is a death trap. If I ride the death trap to leave the Peninsula, it runs right into a far worse death trap...the Tacoma and Seattle area.\n\nMy wife, kinda' the boss...says I cannot buy another bike and ride unless we move to Montana or Idaho in the country. I could play hard ass and do it anyway but think she's probably right. So far, over 50 years of dirt, race and road riding, and it never sent me to the hospital. But I can feel it coming in this rat race. And at 70 years old, I hate the thought of moving again, and also feel I need to be on a bike until I croak..but not croak on the street due to some idiot. CONUNDRUM!\n\nAnyone else here that can't escape riding with the odds stacked against you?\n\nOkay, enough ranting and poor, pitiful me stuff. Maybe I just need a hug or a new prostate.",
