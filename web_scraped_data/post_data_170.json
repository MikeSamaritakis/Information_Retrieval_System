  "Content": "Hello, I rebuilt my carb recently and it all seemed to go pretty well- disassembled, cleaned, replaced old parts with new, re-assembled with new gaskets.\n\nAfter the rebuild I took it for a ride, it ran well enough, in fact, it ran almost the same as it had before I worked on it. I rode it back, parked it, and came out the next day to re-assemble the fairing, etc.\n\nOil had leaked out all over under the bike. I hadn't touched the oil plug or anything associated with it recently. When I looked more closely, it appeared that the carb had a leak (the carb and area around it were wet whereas they were not the day before), and my assumption is that the gas leaked out of the carb and somehow got down into the crank case, over filled it, and gas and oil leaked out- no other explanations made sense.\n\nAnyway, I don't know enough about carbs to understand how that could have happened or which of the many wee parts I replaced to look at. Is there an obvious cause, or do I just get to disassemble and re-assemble the carb again, hoping that does it? Strangely, the fuel valve was set to 'off', but the tank was almost empty.\n\nnot sure it matters- my title says I have a '59, but the vin on the frame says it's a '64.",
