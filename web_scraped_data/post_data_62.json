  "Content": "I recently helped my neighbor repair his 125cc Buddy Scooter. It had sat for over 3 years and the carb was bad, probably gummed up. I told him we could take it apart and clean/rebuild it, but he just bought another one for under $40. I noticed the carb would likely fit on my XL125 project bike except it had an automatic choke that required 12v power. The carb was a Keihin and seemed to be of decent quality. Does anyone have an opinion whether or not this carb would work on the old XL125 if I rebuilt and/or cleaned it up? I'm just curious and suppose I could give it a try. I would just have to wire up the automatic choke to power. The neighbor offered to give me the old carb, so it would only cost me the price of a rebuild kit.",
