  "Content": "Anyone have any good suggestions for a place they like to buy handlebars from? I know exactly what I want but am having a hard time finding enough detailed info on websites to find it. Seems like everyone is haphazard with pics or what measurements they provide.\n\nI want either 7/8\" bars or 1-1/8\" center clamp tapering to 7/8\" bars with 6-8\" rise with the ends angling back as close to a 45 degree angle as I can get and with the ends coming back down buckhorn style.\n\nBasically exactly like these but 2-4\" less rise:\n\n\n\n\nNice to haves:\n\n29-36\" wide\nSteel\nBlack\nNot too expensive, something decent but not too fancy like Emgo OEM reproduction quality or similar would be fine.\n\nAny ideas or leads would be greatly appreciated.",
