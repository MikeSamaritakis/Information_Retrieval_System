  "Content": "Need to some advice.\nI only just recently noticed that my engine makes a hissing sound when I shut it off.\nSomebody suggest that it was pressure being released from the petrol tank but I am doubtful.\n\nI started the bike from cold and did not give it enough time to warm up, then shut it off and I can still hear a hissing sound.\nNo idea if it is compressed air or a vacumme hiss.\n\nAnybody experience this before?",
