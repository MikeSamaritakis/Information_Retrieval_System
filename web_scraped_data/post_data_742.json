  "Content": "We are cleaning up the farm after my Dad passed away and came across this vintage Kawasaki from the 60\u2019s. I believe it is a 1966 Kawasaki F1.\n\nI can\u2019t find a serial number for the bike. Does anyone know where this is located.\n\nThe bike hasn\u2019t run in many years, but it appears this could have value to the right collector. Appreciate any advice you may have",
