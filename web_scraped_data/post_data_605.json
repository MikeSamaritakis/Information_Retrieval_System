  "Content": "I have an 83 cb650 nighthawk that was given to me by my great grandad. The bike was sitting for close to 30 years but I completely restored it. The engine runs and idles fine but the issue I\u2019m having is it won\u2019t go when I put it into gear, it will rev up in gear but won\u2019t move. I\u2019ve replaced the clutch disc and springs, rebuilt the slave cylinder with a kit from online, new master cylinders, & new brake and clutch hoses but still nothing. I even made sure the neutral position sensor was good which it was. The shaft spins when I rotate the wheel in neutral as well. At this point I\u2019m generally lost but don\u2019t have the money to take to a shop, I do have car knowledge because that\u2019s what I generally work on. Any suggestions?",
