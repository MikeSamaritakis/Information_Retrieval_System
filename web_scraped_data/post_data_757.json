  "Content": "Hi. My name is John, and I have a problem with buying old motorcycles. Been riding since 2012, and I've had 7 bikes, 3 of which still live and run (of the other 4, 3 were sold and my first, '79 Honda CM400T is a trophy above my workbench).\nOld bikes include:\n1st. '79 Honda CM400T (cafe racer. Blew 2 engines in her. Good bike, kept the frame and wheels)\n2nd. '04 Honda shadow. (Bought off a fellow marine because his wife was pregnant. 1st ex wife took it in the divorce.)\n3rd. '86 Suzuki Intruder 700 (still have her. Love her. Plan on giving her to my daughter one day.)\n4th. '84 Honda Goldwing (I miss it, but bad knees meant I couldn't hold it up anymore. Full dressed. Sold to a neighbor)\n5th. '88 Honda sabre (traded a running Cadillac for a non running motorcycle at a junkyard. Got it running and sold it.)\n6th. 2002 Suzuki Intruder 1400 (talked girlfriend into getting it. She named it Blueberry because it's blue.)\n7th. 1998 Suzuki Intruder 1500 (named SugarLoaf. She is GREEN.)",
