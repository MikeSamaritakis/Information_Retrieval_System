  "Content": "Hello my name is Josiah I'm almost 17 I'm new to motorcycle riding as in I haven't gotten my motorcycle license yet but I do have some bikes. I have a 1972 bc 750 that has a junk engine im thinking about putting a 10 hp diesel engine from Amazon in it. I also have a Honda cx 500c that I got as a basket case and will need a new stator. I do have experience as a small engine mechanic I'm hoping that will help with these bikes!",
