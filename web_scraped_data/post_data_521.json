  "Content": "I have this 2009 Suzuki GZ250, it didn't run or even turn over when i got her last month I had to rebuild the top end with new piston and cylinder head just so I could turn the engine over. I started checking electrical parts and needed a new ignition coil . Not to bad. Checked the pickup coil and stator and they checked out using multimeter . tried to start it and no spark . I pulled the ignitor and the manual has a chart to check the pins of the cdi. I was not getting any values on most of the pin combinations. So i started looking on Ebay etc. to find a new one but i was unpleasantly surprised to find how much$ they want for a sealed box with a few simple electronics inside. I took a chance on a 25$ new cdi for a 250cc Suzuki z something but although the plug would work the pin combination Measurment's (ohms) don't fit what the manual says. Now what to do.",
