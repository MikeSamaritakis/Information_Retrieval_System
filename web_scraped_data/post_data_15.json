  "Content": "Sag adjustment on a dirt bike is a very important part of set up, but what about street bikes? \u201cGiving up\u201d about 1/3 of one\u2019s travel when you have 12-13\u201d to work with is one thing and I was always curious about it, but does this apply when you only have 5\u201d to work with?\nI\u2019ve adjusted (decreased from stock) my new street bike preload front and rear just by butt-feel/ride comfort, but never thought to check the actual numbers. FWIW I\u2019m about 175# geared up. Just curious because sag never seems to be a topic of general conversation, but maybe is with the road racer types🤷🏻\u200d♂️",
