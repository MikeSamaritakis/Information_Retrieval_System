  "Content": "I need your kind help and expert opinions identifying the motorcycle below, and anything else you can determine about the rider, location, time...\n\nThis image appears in the works of American visual artist Robert Rauschenberg. Its earliest appearance was in 1965, so the bike is older than that. The image is likely a tear out from a magazine.\n\nI would like the make and model of the bike. Also its purpose, for example is it a racing set-up? Maybe you can tell me something about the rider via his clothing and helmet. Anything you can determine from the image would be useful--I'm currently writing a piece involving Rauschenberg's work.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n1990 image\n\n\n1965 image",
