  "Content": "Just picked up an 84' 650 Nighthawk and was changing the oil. Pulled off the oil filter cover, seemed to come off easy enough. Went to reinstall it and it won't go all the way on. The bolt comes to a stop before the filter cover is mated to the engine. I've got the tab lined up, but it feels like I'll break the bolt if I keep tightening. Can't figure it out. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\nI also took off the carbs and rebuilt them and all seems to be good, but nothing else can happen if I can't get the oil filter back on.",
