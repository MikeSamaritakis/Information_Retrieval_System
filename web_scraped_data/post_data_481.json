  "Content": "I am currently in between motorcycles. Bought the manual and going to rebuilt my 84 and 86 honda magna 1100's so fsr the old power cruiser is my favorite motorcycle and ride.. any suggestions for something I would like better? Just don't want anything sluggish or slowish the slowest thing I been ok was a 2017 honda rebel 500.. way to slow. On accel and top speed.. I am currently looking at a 05 kawasaki vulcan 1600. Turn key and ride. Or a 05 yamaha yzr600 needs a new chain and foot pegs but can still turn key and ride as is. Just not sure which would be a better option for commuting daily local and for log rides on days off high way riding.. also looking at a 1998 honda superhawk 996 but he won't come down on price and the other 2 are both 500$cheaper.",
