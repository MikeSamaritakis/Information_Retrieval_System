  "Content": "Hey all, I bought a 1984 Kawasaki ZN750 Shaft drive from a scrap yard for like $250, it was missing the carburetors. So instead of spending a few hundred on a rack from eBay, I went to my local Cycle Salvage and found a set of carbs that were 'close enough', but turns out they don't have vacuum ports (as far as I can tell), and this bike has a vacuum operated petcock (I also want to do a carb sync).\n\nSo my question is, can anyone advise if I can add a vacuum port by drilling into the carb body and adding a barb? I think that's what this spot is for (see pic), however that would put my vacuum line behind the throttle butterfly. Will I get enough vacuum there to run the petcock and do a carb sync?\n\n\nAnother suggestion was to use this passed from the back of the carb, but looking at it, I think it's interrupted by the choke plunger, so would only have vacuum with the choke open?\n\n\nAny suggestions or info would be appreciated, thanks!!",
