  "Content": "Hello,\nI'm Jason from wisconsin and 49 years old. I drive Hondas and currently drive a 1999 Valkyrie. I also have a 1971 CB450. Owned a 2004 VTX1300, but was rear-ended, so that one is totaled. I'm mostly going to be looking for parts, because I'm currently looking for Vintage/classic bikes to rebuild.",
