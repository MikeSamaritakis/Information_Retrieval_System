  "Content": "Hey guys, I only have a few months of riding under my belt, and the sun has started to become a big issue. My buddy swears by photochromic visors, but they are extremely pricey. Would it be better to spend a lot less on a tinted visor, that I won't need to replace in 2 years? Or should I just bring both visors (tinted and clear) with me wherever I go? (Also, kind of just want a blue tinted visor because it'll look cool, instead of just a grey photochromic)\nThanks for any help, ride safe!",
