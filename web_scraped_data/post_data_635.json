  "Content": "Hello, I only have 11 months with brand new 2023 speed twin and the front break began a mild squeaking and it feels like metals rubbing. Happens right before the actual stop. I took to the bmw dealer and they are asking $600 to replace front break issue. I spoke with the sales guy, not bmw dealer, and was informed that apparently people complain that this happens and it\u2019s pretty common. What should I do? Any recommendations suggestions? Thank you",
