  "Content": "A very long story short here.\nWhat a trip! I was 18, sis was 16.\nMom, 2-up behind dad, and sis 2-up behind me. Took the county roads down, and coastal 101 home. Mom wasn't too keen on going but caved. She wasn't all too happy in the frigid weather we ran into during the early morning Oregon high desert. She was a trooper though and rode out the entire round trip. She never ditched us and took a bus or plane home.\nNow that I look back on the trip, often uncomfortable and grueling on those little 450's and just as often exciting and fun, it was something our family did together, and will always be a fond memory.\n\nMom began with a smile. Not sure that lasted long. Dad was smart. He had a fairing and windshield. I didn't because they didn't look \"cool.\" I was the dumb one. Battled wind and bugs the entire trip.\n\n\n\nOn our way to California!",
