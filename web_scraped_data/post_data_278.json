  "Content": "Hi All,\n\nNew here but not new to cycling and the road. Recently I bought a 2003 Kawasaki EN500 Vulcan and we are restoring it, needing to find several parts:\n\n1. Battery,\n2. Carb rebuild kit,\n3. Carb floats,\n4 Fuel distribution tube, between the dual carbs\n\nThe Battery has unusual dimensions and most selling them use metric and I do not so measurements for this must be exact.\n\nWe ordered the carb kit which they advertise as \"fits all years from 1997 to 2020, but it does not, so could only use about 3 parts out of the \"universal\" one they sent, Need the exact one!\n\nThe carb floats are bad so constantly get filed with gas, but can't seem to find these floats online,\n\nThe fuel distribution tube, taking fuel from the tank and distributing to both carbs, part metal, part plastic, and the plastic on the right side broke so is pouring gas everywhere so a huge fire/safety risk. I'm seeing this has a unique name which I do not know, therefore not able to find it.\n\nAny help with me finding these parts is greatly appreciated!\n\nCheers!\n\nTBNK",
