  "Content": "Tim, from Louisiana, and I have a 1982 Honda CB900C with the showa 461 air assist shocks. I'm having a problem with them not holding air pressure, causing the red light of annoyance to light up. I've use leak check on the connections and hoses, but found no air bubbles. Does anyone have any info on rebuilding these shocks?",
