  "Content": "Disclaimer: Before one says \"do a search\" I did; \"oil\" sorted by date and went back approximately 3 years.\nProof of my search: 😇\n\n\nI did not see an oil thread like this one. 😁\nAssuming that we use motorcycle oil, do we use full synthetic or dino?\nIf you have more than one motorcycle, vote your majority use.\n\nIf you have put lots (<--subjective) of miles on a motorcycle(s) using either type of motorcycle oil with or without incident, such information is welcome.\n\nI run full synthetic in my cars and plan on doing the same in my motorcycles.\n\nETA: I thought after I made this thread that some motorcycles may be able to run on oil made for cars, like if they don't have a \"wet\" clutch (example). I'd change the last poll option to reflect that but I can't edit the poll. So, please excuse wording of that poll option to a moment of stupidity. Thanks.",
