  "Content": "I got my first ride of the season in today. Just a bit over 100 miles. The bike was flawless as usual. I got home about 20 minutes ahead of the eclipse totality of 3:12. It was definitely weird for that last 15-20 minutes with the declining light. But anyway, I was extremely happy with the ride, and now tomorrow I\u2019m back to work. I am retired, but work part time.",
