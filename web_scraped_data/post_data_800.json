  "Content": "This is my first post, so if I do something wrong please let me know so I don't do it again. Here goes. Looking for 1985 Honda VF1100C V65 Magna air cleaner parts: case 17205MB4000 and base 17230MB4000. I've searched all the online parts stores to no avail, so I'm hoping to get some help here. Sure appreciate anything you can offer. I've tossed about printing them if I can get enough pics to produce 1:1 scale for 3D creation to send to a 3D printer.\nLinks to show detail: https://www.cmsnl.com/honda-vf1100c-magna-1985-f_model50053/case-air-cleaner_17205mb4000/\nhttps://www.cmsnl.com/honda-vf1100c-magna-1985-f_model50053/case-air-cleaner_17230mb4000/\nAttached are the parts that came on the bike. I think if I can get these I'll be on my way to a promising start on bike rehab. Thank you in advance for anything you can offer.\n\nBRD7",
