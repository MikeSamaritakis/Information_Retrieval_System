  "Content": "Was doing 60 on bypass and bike started to loose speed very gradually but I could feel the power going, shortly after it slowed to 20 mph and sounded horrible then died after around half a mile and now won't start\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI had a similar problem a few weeks ago where the bike suddenly slowed to 40mph and then picked back up to full speed, but developed a ticking noise after this, I check the oil after wiping the dipstick and winding back in it was dry when pulling out, though there was still some oil in the engine\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the previous issue i assumed this morning was obviously a seizure, however,\n\n\n\nBike is as easy to push as normal\n\nCan turn the crank with a ratchet with little effort (sparkplug not removed for this)\n\nCan feel compression stroke when turning crank\n\nCan clearly hear starter motor turning over when pressing starter button\n\n\nThe bike was very low on petrol this morning and whilst it still seems to have some in there I'm wondering if it could've sucked some sediment in and choked the bike out? Haven't got a sparkplug socket as of yet but presuming that's the best place to start both to see if there's compression or if the plug is fouled?\n\nGrateful for any advice given",
