  "Content": "We are looking to do some biking in Slovenia. I've done some research. We will probably be using road bikes and going about 30-40 miles a day. We are not looking to do a lot of climbing. If we do, then we will rent electric bikes. We will probably do a 10 day trip next month with 4-5 days of biking with wine and food touring the other days.\nHas anyone experiences with bike rent Bled? Did you find good hotels where you could wash your bike clothes? Any areas you liked better than others?\n\nThanks for any input.",
