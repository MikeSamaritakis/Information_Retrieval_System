  "Content": "Any suggestions for what I can use to prevent marks while using my scooters centre kick stand on my driveway I do not have anything to hand and was thinking a plastic platemat that I cut to fit in my seat bucket could do the trick-all that turning the handle bars whilst cleaning and working on my bike can leave marks, I know I could be extra careful and counter balance this issue most likely but I have been looking at side kick stand products on eBay but there is nothing for the centre kick stand that creates this issue?",
