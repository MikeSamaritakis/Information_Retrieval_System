  "Content": "Hi! My title says I have a 1959 C100, but when I look up the VIN stamped on the frame (which is C100S######), the reference chart I found says that in C100S, the S means it's a 1966, and the Engine has C100E... on it, which means it's from 1962?\n\nSomething's not right, I guess. I'm not too bent out of shape about it, though the idea I had a '59 was novel.\n\nMaybe it just got juggled wrong at some point in the past? Seems like older imports with 11-digit VINs didn't always fare so well.",
