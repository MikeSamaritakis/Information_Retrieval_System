  "Content": "Hello riders and mechanics.\nTo start off, I\u2019ll make it honest and simple. I love motorcycles and have had a few in my life time. But I\u2019m not by any means an expert. I understand body mechanics for cars. Anyways, yada yada bla bla right? So above is a pic of what I would need to get info on. Firstly being a rider and not a mechanic, this is a CDI box? It doesn\u2019t have any labels/model brand etc. I\u2019m told that I need a new module, from my electrician (Spanish guy who doesn\u2019t speak a word of English, and get around via his wife who translates) . He does general electrical work and doesn\u2019t really specialize in bikes, though he\u2019s good for it. He told me that \u201cI had to get one of these\u201d If you notice, my module or cdi box, whatever it is, has been scorched! I had flames under my butt, which I had to pull over and put them out. (Flames for paint work=üëç actual flames=üëé). This is for a 113 ci s&s motor. It\u2019s not made on an assembly line, so there\u2019s no way I can truly ever go shop at a Harley store. My question is 1)what is it? CDI? Do they catch fire often? it\u2019s a six pin (actual screw driver looking heads and not flat). 2) where would a good place be to get these ? I see they apparently go for 900$ and as cheap as 12$, major difference in price clearly. Thank you for your help and happy riding\n\nVin",
