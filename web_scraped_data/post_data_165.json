  "Content": "New to this forum after lurking for a while. Great body of knowledge here for sure!👍🏻\nI\u2019m a 60 something returning to the road rider. Rode most of the late 70s through early 90\u2019s while in school and early career- CB400T, CB650, Sabre 750 and Zephyr750. Then for 30 years raced HS and MX - too many to mention. My user name of Noclutch is a reference to my few years of MTB racing🥵- there ain\u2019t no clutch to help you out of a jam.\n\nNow I\u2019ve decided to get back to bikes that won\u2019t beat me up so much, nor consume a whole day getting there, back and recovery. Lol. I\u2019m not so much of a racer-type mindset anymore that I would want a full on sport bike- I wouldn\u2019t/couldn't use it to its potential- too old for that, plus would my body wouldn\u2019t appreciate it! But also not wanting to do the cruiser scene either- I ain\u2019t that social. But group rides would be fine as long as they want to ride more than talk. I\u2019ll primarily be doing low population backroads on weekend mornings at a sane pace and some local errand runs.\nWhile researching my new bike I\u2019ve been taking note of all the things that have, and haven\u2019t changed. After much deliberation, I decided on this. And yes, the traction control and ABS are set to full nanny for now. It reminds me of the RZ 350 I kick myself in the butt to this day for not getting!\n\n\nIf you\u2019re in the Ocala, Florida area maybe we\u2019ll cross paths 😊",
