  "Content": "I put my gl500 on pods and straight pipes and re jetted the carb at 120 main 90 secondary. And now it won\u2019t rev past 8000 rpm. Is this due to carbs being out of sync? It ran fine with pods and straight pipes before re jetting, just the occasional afterburn.do you think it\u2019s just the carbs out of sync or could it be something else? I have a carb sync coming from Amazon but I wanted to see what you all thought as well.",
