  "Content": "Now that the Easter festivities are over, I'm DONE schlepping cages to and from repair appointments, and almost all of my farkles are here, I'm FINALLY working on getting them installed on the NINJA 400!\n\n\nI had to start with a couple of simple things to give me a sense of accomplishment.\n\n\nNote to self: Get one of these for the 650! Sheldon's is pretty worn from being dragged on the pavement so much when I move him around.. And these just look really cool!!\n\nThen I pulled out \"The Bible\"...\n\n...and looked up chapter and verse for how to remove the necessary Tupperware in order to install the frame sliders.\n\n\nWith the indispensable help of my father-in-law (He figured out how to remove the stupid fuse boxes), I got the left one installed before I had to go make supper.\n\n\nAfter supper and evening outdoor chores, I installed the Denali SoundBomb Mini in the stock location (YES!!!!), followed by the swingarm spools.\n\n\n\nBefore cleaning up for the night so Bug could park in his spot, I took pictures of the bolts on the right side Tupperware before it's removed; otherwise, I might not remember which ones go where, once it's time to put it back on.\n\nAnd I may have come up with a name...Gotta chew on it a little bit...\n\nMore to come!",
