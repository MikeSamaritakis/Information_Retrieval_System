  "Content": "Hello everyone, I just bought my first scooter for 60 bucks. I THINK that it is a kymco super 8 50cc 2t. If someone can verify that would be amazing. It doesn't currently run but has compression. I'll start with a battery and some fuel and then use the kick start to try and start it.

If anyone can start guiding me to get this thing running and moving again I'd be incredibly grateful. Here's some pics",
