  "Content": "I have a 2007 Yamaha R6 that I am currently doing a valve check for the very first time. She has 19k miles and idled very rough to the point where it would die at stops or in neutral. I took the valve cover off and was able to check the first two valves then I went to turn the motor clockwise using the 12mm nut and it turned alittle then just the nut rotated. It will continue just to rotate without moving the sprockets/ camchain, and cams. Im unsure what to do next as I am wanting to check the other valves.",
