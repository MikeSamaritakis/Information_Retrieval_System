  "Content": "Hi. My name is John, and I have a problem with buying old motorcycles. Been riding since 2012, and I've had 7 bikes, 3 of which still live and run (of the other 4, 3 were sold and my first, '79 Honda CM400T is a trophy above my workbench).\nThe latest edition is a '98 Suzuki Intruder 1500. In this episode, John avoids paying 6-$700on a new speedometer/instrument cluster.\nCurrently, the speed needle points to the 6 o'clock position with a broken tip, but typically ready +20-+30 mph. The odo used to work, then went a week where it kept 0 'ing out, now it currently reads 100 miles.\nI would love to rebuild the board and try and save some money, but I'll spend it if I have to.\nAnyone out there who's available to help troubleshoot the individual components on the board/offer guidance on replacement parts for the board?",
