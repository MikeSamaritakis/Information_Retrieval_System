  "Content": "Hi everybody. I grew up on a farm and my dad bought us a Honda 90 which we used and abused heavily. Then I graduated to an Ossa 250 motocross bike that I tried to jump the drainage ditch with and did not make it to the other side. I went over the handlebars and bruised the front of my legs so heavily I could not walk the next morning. I'll never forget my dad laughing as I crawled up the steps for breakfast the next day.\n\nMy brother raced flat trackers at the Sycamore Speedway in IL in the 70s. So, our family has had a few bikes through the years.\n\nI'm here now to help the neighbor boy with a Honda XR100 he got from his uncle before he passed away. There are a lot of problems with this bike, but I've done a lot of small engine repairs and hope to get some help from the repairs section of this forum.\n\nAlso did some repairs on a Kawasaki my son and I picked up for cheap after the owner plugged the oil pathway with gasket sealer and wrecked the valve cam and head. Fixed it and sold it. I think it was a KM100.\n\n\n\n\nGood to be here.",
