  "Content": "Hi, I'm Mike, currently living in Fullerton, CA. I am married and have a son and daughter. I met my wife while living in Hawaii, where I attended the University of Hawaii at Manoa and surfed a lot. Although I have been riding since I was 15, I stopped after I crashed into a car that turned left in front of me. Not because I no longer wanted to ride, but because I couldn't find and/or afford the parts to fix my Norton 850 Commando.\n\n2 yrs ago, at age 68, inheritance funds allowed me to start riding again. I started with two HD Sportsters, a 2006 Sportster XL1200L Low and a 2009 XR1200. Last summer I added a 2010 HD Dyna Super Glide. Recently, I got a 1981 Suzuki GS250T for the purpose of using it to pass the skills portion of the California motorcycle test, which is really a low-speed maneuverability test, difficult to pass on a large bike. If you're interested and can tolerate my long-windedness, I have a much longer description on my profile.\n\nSince I'm old now, I find my riding style has changed from my younger aggro days, which I somehow survived. Now, as a guy on one of my other forums puts it, \"I ride like an old guy, who wants to get older.\"",
