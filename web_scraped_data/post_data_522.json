  "Content": "My Honda VTX 1300 has developped an intermittent trouble since about a year. When the bike has rested overnight, the clutch is noisy and does not engage smoothly when I release the clutch handle. After 7 or 8 gear shifts, the plate seems to lube enough and the clutch is functioning as it should.\n\nI wonder what is the matter and what I should do.\n\nAny suggestion is welcome.\n\nThanks",
