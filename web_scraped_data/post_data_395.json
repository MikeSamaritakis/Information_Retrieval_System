  "Content": "Hello, I recently purchased a Yamaha LT2 off fb. It isn\u2019t in terrible condition but it isn\u2019t starting up. I installed a new ignition coil and confirmed that it has good spark. I took off the carb and inspected it. The previous owner had it running not long before I got it so I don\u2019t think one of the jets is clogged. The oil injection system is also deleted. Any help/suggestions on what to do to get the bike running is greatly appreciated.",
