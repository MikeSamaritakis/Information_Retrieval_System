  "Content": "Back in 1974-77 time frame, I owned a Yamaha Trail bike that I can't seem to find on the internet or by calling Yamaha dealers. This bike was yellow with a crossbar on the handlebar, and a small luggage rack. But the thing that made it stand out is that it had an extra lever on the engine that you could kick it one way for hill climbing, and the other way for trail riding. I'm pretty sure it was a 4 stroke cause I don't ever remember having to mix the oil and gas on any bike I've ever owned.\nIf anyone remembers this bike or has seen one like it, I'm just trying to find out the model and year it was made. As I've said I can't find any info on this bike anywhere.\nThanks for any assistance on this.\n\nDave (Rotohawg)",
