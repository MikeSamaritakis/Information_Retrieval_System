  "Content": "I tried to start my '96 Goldwing today at about 2Celcius. I gave it full choke and tried to start it about 8 times until the battery was almost dead. I don't think I let the starter turn over any longer than 8 seconds at the longest and most of the tries were under 5 seconds. I thought the battery should have lasted longer than that. I have had the battery maintainer on it since I stopped riding in October.\n\nDo you think the battery is weak?\nShould the maintainer have kept the battery at 80% or more?\nHow much did the cold weather affect the starting?\nCan I charge the battery with the charger in the picture below?\n\nThanks for any help and/or suggestions.",
