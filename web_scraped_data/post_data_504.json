  "Content": "This is my dirt bike in the late 1970s. It was sold in 1981 and I haven\u2019t ridden a dirtbike since. I recently digitized a lot of 35 mm film. Can someone help me identify the specific model of this bike? I know it was a 250 but I don\u2019t know the model and I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s possible to identify the year. It was great fun to ride . Thank you.",
