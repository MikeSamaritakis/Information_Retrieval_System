{"Content":"Hello riders and mechanics.\nTo start off, I‚Äôll make it honest and simple. I love motorcycles and have had a few in my life time. But I‚Äôm not by any means an expert. I understand body mechanics for cars. Anyways, yada yada bla bla right? So above is a pic of what I would need to get info on. Firstly being a rider and not a mechanic, this is a CDI box? It doesn‚Äôt have any labels/model brand etc. I‚Äôm told that I need a new module, from my electrician (Spanish guy who doesn‚Äôt speak a word of English, and get around via his wife who translates) . He does general electrical work and doesn‚Äôt really specialize in bikes, though he‚Äôs good for it. He told me that ‚ÄúI had to get one of these‚Äù If you notice, my module or cdi box, whatever it is, has been scorched! I had flames under my butt, which I had to pull over and put them out. (Flames for paint work=üëç actual flames=üëé). This is for a 113 ci s&s motor. It‚Äôs not made on an assembly line, so there‚Äôs no way I can truly ever go shop at a Harley store. My question is 1)what is it? CDI? Do they catch fire often? it‚Äôs a six pin (actual screw driver looking heads and not flat). 2) where would a good place be to get these ? I see they apparently go for 900$ and as cheap as 12$, major difference in price clearly.

{"Content":"Leo is a lovely canyon carver, comfortable highway mile eater, and highly efficient traffic dispatcher. While it seems to be gaining weight as a meander through my 74th year lapping the sun, I have no thoughts of giving up its favorable attributes.\n\nHowever, it is quite unsuitable for keeping Piglet company when the spousal unit wants to take a short putt on our area's back roads. Dr Zee is just the prescription for that. He can follow her pace in 1st and 2nd gear with occasional shifts to 3rd when she 'opens er up' on paved stretches. Plus he is light and now, with the smaller wheels and tires, is easy for me to flatfoot and control at stops.\n\nHowever, Dr Zee is a bit buzzy on the main artery in our area where the limits and typical speeds are around 70 mph. So I picked up a vintage BMW to fill that space AND to have a cool, relatively sophisticated and reliable bike playing a bit of a double role there.\n\nTHEN I tripped over a nice 2011 BMW F650GS that could replace both Dr Zee and the R90 for about the same price. I rode it today and agreed to buy it by the end of the week.\n\nWhat a sweetheart. Spousal unit dreams it might replace THREE bikes, while I seriously doubt that, it is a whole bunch lighter than Leo and has some potential. I told her I am open to that as a possibility, but find it unlikely.\n\nThe new steed even comes with a zip-on tank bag and two aluminum hard cases... though if I was going far I still think Leo would get the nod. The 6-speed gearbox provides the right ratio for whatever I want at the moment and has a HUGE gear selector indicator removing all doubt. That and the analog gauges are all well thought out and the heated grip, signals and other switchgear look and work just like those on my R1200RT... familiar turf.\n\nThe GS putters along comfortably in the 15-25 mph range that Piglet enjoys, zips to 70++, cruises at 70++ without drama, accelerates quickly and easily in the 60-80mph overtaking zone, is at least 100 pounds lighter than Leo and feels well balanced at low and no speed. Its versatility has me thinking it could end up being \"Jack\" for Jack of all trades.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"taking a stir stick to the motorcycle stable","Author":"Bitterroot Bugler","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/taking-a-stir-stick-to-the-motorcycle-stable.253729/","Date":"2024-04-21","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"At the risk of starting a long drawn out thread similar to asking about one's preferred oil, I thought I would ask everyone what brand of motorcycle tires they prefer. I am getting new tires and had selected some Dunlops, but the salesman talked me into some more expensive Michelins. The stock tyres on my Triumph were Metzlers and they were fine. I usually use Bridgestone or Shinko tires on my dirtbikes. When buying car tires, I have a favorite local tire shop and buy the mid-priced tires that the shop has in stock or can get quickly. I generally don't have a brand loyalty or preference. Just curious what everyone else thinks or does with respect to tires. Of course, comparisons would have to be made using equivalent grades of tires.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"What's your favorite brand of motorcycle tire (tyre) ?","Author":"Sparkman","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/whats-your-favorite-brand-of-motorcycle-tire-tyre.253690/","Date":"2024-04-17","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"I need to remove the carbs. I've done it before, and it's really difficult. The part that makes it most difficult is the filter box. It doesn't slide back far enough to allow the boots to clear the carbs. I hope there is an easier way. BTW, I have the factory service manual, and the Clymer manual, both make it seem like a half-hour job, and don't cover the things I'm mentioning. Several things I've done to make it easier, (but still not easy) is to remove the two screws holding the air box in the back, and removing the voltage regulator from the left side of the air box. This allows the air box to slide a little further back, but not quite enough to give enough room to slide the carbs out easily. I've been removing the boots, but it's quite difficult and I'm afraid I will tear one. Could removing the inner fender make it easier?

{"Content":"My favorite cornering practice 'track' is a 15-mile stretch of highway 93 over the pass between Montana and Idaho. In both directions there is a lot of double lanes (passing lanes) on the uphill portions ... on the Montana uphill, the whole curvy stretch is one lane down and two up. Both ways have very nice pavement on curves from 2nd gear sweepers into high 4th or 5th. I view it as a great place to develop my cornering skills - pushing closer to the edges so I have the confidence and practice necessary to tighten turns elsewhere if that is required in a tight spot.\n\nYesterday was my first outing on Leo for the year and I wanted to start with that bit of cornering practice ... building from conservative up to wherever reasonable caution took me on 2024's maiden RT ride.\n\nI noticed strips of traction sand where the four wheelers had not dusted it off the road surface, but those patches were few, far between and never in my lines ... until ... they were.\n\nDang! I love those Michelin Road 5s.\n\nI was leaning well into a right-hander with zero traffic. I was centered to the right edge of the middle lane (room to burn on both sides of me). Then I observed an unusual patch of sand on my trajectory - and I was already in it. Leo danced a bit, felt slightly loose, but tracked through it like a champ.\n\nMy community service completed for the day by moving that sand off the correct line, I greatly intensified my concentration on seeing traction sand patches before I felt them. One was enough - and that's exactly what I got. I also cut my ride short, turning around at the top rather than finding how well the Idaho Highway Department had done on sanding and cleanup of their share of my school room.\n\nTomorrow is the first Sunday Morning Breakfast Club run over famous Highway 12 from Lolo to Lochsea. I have to ride an hour of slab before arriving at the starting point which takes a little polish off that apple. I have decided to forgo this one and let the sportier guys and another week or two of regular traffic sweep the traction sand of the sweet corners up and over Lolo Pass.\n\nTip for early season riding where traction sand is use for winter driver safety: Be vewwy vewwy careful.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nMotorcycle Training, Safety, and Riding Techniques","Title":"Traction sand isn't ... and other cornering surprises","Author":"Bitterroot Bugler","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/traction-sand-isnt-and-other-cornering-surprises.253664/","Date":"2024-04-13","Tags":[]}

The little 500 has also been an \"ok\" commuter but as the weather gets better and I commute more, it's shortcomings are becoming clear.

{"Content":"Hey guys. Bought a 2012 Suzuki boulevard C50T as my first bike with 14,200 miles. Bought back in December 2023 , 26th iv out roughly 800miles on it in the first before changing the oil at 15000 miles. Everything seemed fine. Put another 2500 miles I'm at 17600 and iv used a few \"berryman B-12 fuel treatments....3oz for the 3.5 gallon full tank. Less then recommended. And added new exhaust...cobra slash.. never got it tuned cause I like the backfire. But that was the first thing I did with the oil change. That's a little the back story...the problem (that we think is a problem) I'm replacing the clutch cause the clutch seems to have been going or just recently got worse. Either way we looked at the oil and noticed it's almost empty. Can't even see it in the sight glass. Oil pressure light isn't on so there is some oil in there...but we're not sure where it could have gone...\n\nSo we are thinking...\n\nOption 1: the clutch has been burning up the oil considering I didn't know the clutch has been slipping till recently. The bike shifted funny since we bought it. But has gotten way worse.\n\nOption 2: the engine just happens to burn oil at a higher rate then normal\n\nOption 3: the berryman B12 screwed up the rings and I'm losing oil out the exhaust cause theres no clear wet oil spots anywhere else on the engine.

{"Content":"This has been a strange year. Last Fall I took my last ride of the year around November 15th, not expecting to ride again until at least mid-March. But we had incredible weather toward the end of February and I was out at least seven or eight times on one of my two bikes between that time and early March. Then Winter returned, and with a vengeance. More snow than we had seen in the last couple of years and cold, nasty weather almost every day. Now here it is April and it was still 26 degrees this morning. I'll be away for the total eclipse, but I am hoping that when I get back, so will riding weather. At my age I hate to see time go by where I can't or won't ride (I don't ride just for the sake of saying I got the chance to ride, if its no fun due to cold, rain, wind or whatever, then what's the point of riding?).\n\nI turn 81 in less than two months. Right after my birthday in early June I plan on taking what well might be my last long motorcycle trip. Right now I'm not sure if I will head West from northern Illinois to South Dakota/possibly Wyoming, or head East to Dayton, OH to visit the USAF museum that I've wanted to visit for the last several years.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Waiting for Spring","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/waiting-for-spring.253598/","Date":"2024-04-06","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"Hello all; my first post here!\n\nI have a 2020 SC c125 that I just purchased. It has 1200 miles on it and was serviced (First service) by the dealer at 580 miles. I noticed what sounds a bicycle with a baseball card clipped to the frame and that card contacting each spoke as the wheel turns (yeah, I'm old and we used to do this sort of thing in the 70's, as kids. I changed the oil for good measure, yet the valve train (or injector) noise remains. I adjusted the valves and I think there was a slight improvement. No noise at idle or WOT, but I can bring it on and higher RPMs (not redline high, mind you) when in-between rolling on/off the throttle - basically higher RPM, but not under load. I'm hoping someone here is familiar with the Super Cub c125 horizontal motor and can tell me if this is,\n\na) A normal characteristic of this motor (FI, valve train, etc.)\nb) Something else that needs addressing (CAM chain tensioner, valves, tappets, etc.)\n\nI asked the prior owner and of course, he said that noise was there from day one (\"a\" above).\n\nIf the consensus is defective CAM chain Tensioner, I was hoping to just drain the oil and pull the tensioner sealing bolt, spring, pushrod and pushrod head - and not have to pull the right case cover, flywheel, etc.\n\nIf normal, how can I quiet this engine some? Using 10w40, instead of 10w-30? Move from a 14T front sprocket to a 15T sprocket? Other?\n\nThanks for any tips or suggestions. Links about this (and the fix) would also be appreciated.

{"Content":"It was 1967 in Burien, WA when my father bought his first and last Ducati, a 1967 Sebring 350.\n\"Hop on the back, son. I'll take you for a ride.\"\n\nWe ventured down the road a few miles, and it was instant 2-wheel love for me from then on. A person either loves to be on a bike or doesn't. Seems there is no in-between. But I wanted to ride one myself after being two-up with my dad, and on the road at that.\n\nIt's funny how we can recall the smallest details, and why. For me, the geometric headlight can was a focus for me. Seems like it was possibly a polygon. Weird me, taking in the shape of a headlight.\n\nYeah, so I wanted to ride that bike...any bike, on the street just like dad. \"Dad, when can I ride this?\" I didn't particularly like the answer. \"In four more years when you get your license at 16, son.\" Ahhh, the pain! Four years is a week today, but a decade when you're 12 years old.\n\nBut all was not lost, as my dad moved the family out into what was then the country above Issaquah, WA on 2 acres with about 1K acres of dirt, an abandoned gravel pit, and forested trail riding territory right from our home. I had turned 13. So, 2-wheeled heaven came to me in the form of a very basic mini-bike my dad bought from a friend, used, for $40.00. I couldn't be happier! Other than chores, I was on that minibike every spare minute I had, rain or shine.\n\nThat started a thing which continues today at my ripe old age of 70 this year. The bikes got bigger as I made more money working part time through high school, and even did a short stint of flat track racing before I joined the Navy.\n\nMy dad never stopped buying and riding motorcycles either, and I was lucky enough to ride with him on many trips...just the two of us, when I retired from the Navy in 1998, and always with fishing gear on the back of our bikes. Dad became a deputy Sheriff in King County, WA at age 35, and one of his many positions was being a motorcycle cop when they put him on an AMF hog. He loved that job. The bike was in the shop a lot (AMF, right?). We rode in every weather condition you can think of, slept on the ground, in a parking lot, in motels, and even on picnic tables in a very wet park. We rode together until he was 77, when he decided he was pressing his luck. He passed 5 years ago. I'll miss the finest riding buddy and father that, IMO, ever existed.\n\nGot a photo of dad here at 34 years old on his Ducati Sebring in 1967 near North Bend, WA. Note the Cig, boat shoes, T-shirt and no helmet! I think he could have doubled for Steve McQueen!\nPhoto is reversed.

{"Content":"I'm almost 50. I took took the MSF course in December (23) and bought a bike in January '24'. 2014 Yamaha Bolt. I've spent the last four months learning how to control the bike. Slow speed left and right turns. U- turns, twistys (as they are called), neighborhood traffic... kids, animals, golf carts and the occasional stop sign. I practiced emergency breaking.... locking up front and back tires trying to understand what it's like to not have ABS like a car/ truck has and to know what it's like to lay the bike down because of rider error...a mistake. (Dropping a bike sucks!!) Then on to the highway. Accelerating to 65 plus Mph. Merging into to faster traffic. The vibrating helmet, blurry mirrors and wind that reminds me that I'm supposed to trust the bike and my tires but also says never forget.... no walls, no airbags just you, your bike, your gear and what you know about 2 wheels. Daunting for sure. Controlling the bike at slow speed has been the biggest challenge. Cuz it seems the the bike does what it's supposed to do when it's moving faster that 10mph. But when it's moving slow....a different skill set.\n\nI've dropped the bike 3 times since I bought it. Once during a slow planned u-turn, second at an intersection with a car that I didn't see and the third in a parking lot with thick gravel I didn't anticipate. I try to chalk it up to being a new rider. I spent $5k not $25k for that reason. Each time I dropped it, was an angry experience. Pissed cuz I dropped my bike, mad cuz I knew why and pushed forward like an angry new rider saying pick it up and go again.\n\nApril is here. I'm making left and right turns, in the neighborhood. Getting on the highway doing 70+. Making uturns. Merging into faster traffic with more comfort. When do I get to the part when I enjoy the ride??","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"New rider learning","Author":"synctek","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/new-rider-learning.253569/","Date":"2024-04-03","Tags":[]}

He told me that ‚ÄúI had to get one of these‚Äù If you notice, my module or cdi box, whatever it is, has been scorched! I had flames under my butt, which I had to pull over and put them out. (Flames for paint work=üëç actual flames=üëé). This is for a 113 ci s&s motor. It‚Äôs not made on an assembly line, so there‚Äôs no way I can truly ever go shop at a Harley store. My question is 1)what is it? CDI? Do they catch fire often? it‚Äôs a six pin (actual screw driver looking heads and not flat). 2) where would a good place be to get these ? I see they apparently go for 900$ and as cheap as 12$, major difference in price clearly. Thank you for your help and happy riding\n\nVin","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nüèç Motorcycle Forums üèç\nChoppers and Showbikes Forum","Title":"CDI box?","Author":"Broken chords","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/cdi-box.253828/#post-2768125","Date":"2024-05-03","Tags":[]}

Still not loving it on the 70-mph artery that leads to just about anywhere from my town, but if I stay close to tiny town, or run the old road to the bigger town (18 miles primarily nice gravel road to Hamilton)\n\nI really like Leo on the open road, and LOVE it on twisties. Considering adding some miles to my area of operation this summer with tank bag and small LEO tail box. Also considering trading it for a non-patrol version with side cases, BUT the super-low 15,000 miles on my fully sorted R1200RT with awesome near-new tires is compelling ... and the transaction cost of changing to a normal one with double, triple or quadruple the miles is intimidating.\n\nI thought the vintage R90/6 would scratch the classic bike itch along with providing a nice intermediate bike between the other two, but it feels like a pig in comparison to either.

Coming from a road cycling background, I kind of don't mind it, I like being visible on the road, and let's face it my motorbike travels a hell of a lot faster than my bicycle. Equates to drivers having less time to notice me on the motorbike.\n\nI'm on my L's for another month or so most likely, as have been riding a fair bit practising a lot of drills/skills and riding on all kinds of roads, so fingers crossed, pass it, then can take the fluro vest off. However, I'm thinking I am way more visible with it on, also have a white helmet, and ride with headlights on high during day. I really try to ride safely, and most importantly be seen, as In riding like I'm invisible out there to all other road users.\n\nIt doesn't look very cool or sharp with the vest on. Everyone here, esp the guys who ride cruisers/Harleys etc, ALL wear black everything, seems like people on sports bike/touring have a little more colour in their motorbike attire.. Is that normal in other countries?\n\nDoes anyone consistently wear fluro vests or other fluro gear out there?\n\nOn a side note I noticed a few bikes with an additional light, one that flashes, similar to what I use on my bicycle. Anyone have any thoughts on those.\n\nSafety V Style... I kinda lead towards anything that will make me more visible, even if I end up looking like a newbie for the rest of my life.\nLove your thoughts and opinions on this.\nAndy","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nMotorcycle Training, Safety, and Riding Techniques","Title":"Hi Viz or not?

No problems until 03/20/2024. I'm a newer rider so the bike has been ridden easy; short rides daily and some parking lot practice.\n\nProblem Details:\nWe arrived home from a 20mi ride then decided to run into town to get gas. Bike was shut off for less than 5 minutes. Turned the key, lights came on as normal, hit the start, relay clicked and all lights immediately shut off / no power.\n\nCurrently it takes about 30 seconds after turning the key for lights to come on and dials to activate. Lights will stay on, but as soon as you hit start everything instantly dies. Relay clicks, but bike does not try to start.\n\nObservations:\nWe haven't had the time to take anything apart yet, and are hoping to dig into it tomorrow. So far what we've looked at is...\nBattery is 12.3V\nVoltage is 12.3 from battery to relay (tried replacing 30 amp fuse, no change).\n\nHas anyone had experience with this or know if this is a common issue with the ~2002 Bandit?

{"Content":"So this came up recently after I was following someone riding, and I noticed almost every time they stop they seem to be struggling a bit because they pretty regularly didn't start putting their foot down until after the bike came to a stop. So I brought this up to them, as I would hope someone would do with me if they saw me doing something that clearly could be done more efficiently, and to my surprise they said if they tried to consciously control their foot when coming to a stop, it would mess them up.\n\nThis led to a whole discussion on the subject of conscious vs unconscious control, and it turned out both of us were somewhat amazed by the other's responses, because it seems like we are on far ends of the spectrum. They don't consciously control almost any of their physical movements, they think where they want to go and they go there, any body motions on the way are completely automatic, this includes walking, running, dancing, driving, and riding, etc. We got into a discussion about braking coming into a corner and they had no idea how they did it, they see the corner, think where they want to go, then somehow braking and steering happens.\n\nThis obviously works for them, but it completely blew me away because I am exactly the opposite, almost EVERYTHING physical I do is completely conscious. If I am very used to the activity, it doesnt take a lot of brain power, but I think about every single step I take when walking, running, dancing, driving, riding, swinging an axe or a hammer, etc. I learned how to drive on a stick decades ago and still each shift requires me to think about it, not a lot, but there is always a small process going that I am aware of going \"ok, you are done with 3rd now, time to shift into 4th, or that hill is coming up so downshift into 2nd\". Everything driving and riding is like this, I consciously steer a car, I consciously countersteer my motorcycle, I choose when to brake, how hard, and which brake to use every single time. This completely blew away the other person, we left this conversation with them confused about how I manage to do anything, and me confused about how they can possibly change anything they are doing, but both of our systems seem to work for us.\n\nSo it got me curious, how many function mostly on automatic for physical movements, and how many are mostly consciously choosing each step?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Do your physical movements happen mostly automatically?

{"Content":"Hi I am looking for some advice on an issue which is quite strange.\n\nI am currently working on a Lexmoto Assault 125 2020 plate. Its EFI. I was having some issues with the indicators not wanting to play ball unless the bike was leaned over or the steering was turned. After removing the fairings and headlight and checking all the cables, terminals and connections, they started to work as normal. However now the EML has come on the dash and the bike is a non start, it is ridden regulary nearly every day and dry stored in a garage overnight . In addition to this the battery is new as of a few weeks back when the old one that was in it when i bought it in November of last year had finally ran dry.\n\nThe strange part of this is with the EML on the bike appears to be priming the fuel pump, once when it turns on as it should but also now when the lights are switched from Dim to High beam and vice versa. To which I assume is causing an issue with the ECU and the EML and obviously the non start now.\n\nIs there any advice that can be given on things to try to remedy this as I would rather not have to put it in a garage and then more than likely an autoelectrician as the money is not there right now.\n\nMany thanks","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß","Title":"Fuel Pump/Electrical Issue","Author":"ChineseBikeEnthusiast","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/fuel-pump-electrical-issue.253489/","Date":"2024-03-22","Tags":["125cc","assault","eml","fuel pump","lexmoto"]}

{"Content":"Thanks to anyone who cares to have a look! I'm just a little lost on what else needs to be done to my bike to get it running smoothly again.\n\nI recently bought my bike and have had some electrical issues which I thought I had sorted but it's still feels strange. My headlight was flickering pretty badly and was quite dull, so I replaced it with a LED headlight just so i felt more comfortable - country roads around Devon at night are fairly sketchy.\n\nOn top of this, there was suggestion that there could be an issue with my regulator, so I replaced it. When that didn't solve the issue and my bike crapped out on me, I replaced the battery which did help with working semi-normally again. Most recently it seemed to be working perfectly until I was riding to work last night and noticed my heated-handlebar grips turned off by themselves again after about 15/20 mins of riding. They were already struggling to stay on before the new battery so this was puzzling as to why it started this issue again. I also noticed that it struggled to accelerate in every gear, however my suspicion is I need to change the oil and air filter (yay for more learning )\n\nSo I finally changed the alternator today, fresh oil and other tune up as necessary and noticed that my headlight is still flickering. Futhermore it struggles to stay on after turning on unless I give it plenty of revs/have the choke on.\n\nAnyone have any suggestions on where to look next? For now I need to focus on the basic functionality and once I have some more money in my pocket I replace more parts if necessary (only recently returned to my home country and have pretty much no money)\n\nThanks again for any suggestions anyone has\n\nAnyone ha","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß","Title":"2001 Suzuki GS500e issues","Author":"claudia.vigar7946","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/2001-suzuki-gs500e-issues.253476/","Date":"2024-03-21","Tags":["acceleration","electrical issues","suzuki gs500e"]}

{"Content":"Well, it's that time again! I put a new set of tires on my 2016 at the beginning of the season in 2020. I bought the 2016 new in 2018. I replaced the factory Dunlop's at just over 5000KM with a nice set of Avon Cobra Chromes. The factory Dunlop's were shot with the rear tread worn down and the front cupped. The recommended rear tire is a 240/40R18M/C 79V. I went with a 250/40R18 81V Avon since the 240 wasn't available at the time (COVID shortages). The 250 looks really good on the bike. I ride a lot of two-up and really liked the new tires. The front tire is still good and doesn't need to be replaced. The Avon's have just over 13000KM (8000 miles) on them. I'm not a fan of mixing brands and models between front and back tires so I'll probably go with another Avon since the front is still good.\n\nI am however considering the Metzler Cruisetec model as a replacement. It looks like a decent tire.

{"Content":"So flipping through stuff on fork oil, it seems like almost the entire conversation is always about viscosity, which sure is important, but that is also like a 20 second sound blip: check the cst viscosity @40c and get the right one for your needs. Moving on.\n\nWhen trying to find out other properties of fork oils, like what is their base oil made from? Mineral? Synthetic? How well do they act as lubricants? How long do they hold up? It seems like the entire field of fork oil is just pretty much an unregulated field full of snake oil, maybe even literally snake oil... Also, price and quality dont SEEM to have much overlap here, full synthetics and possibly something made from rendered roadkill seem to be within a few percentage of each other on cost.\n\nSo for the more experienced out there, what do you go by? Any brands that are known to lubricate better and hold up longer? Any guidelines? Or is it all just trial and error? Or should I just get a bucket of AeroShell fluid 31 for the lighterweight needs and use high quality synthetic engine oil for the hamfisted heavier stuff and call it a day?\n\nEdit: After watching this video discussing how viscosity index and lubricity have a fairly inverse relationship, and knowing that fork oil is usually not much above ambient temp, fork oil marketing heavily emphasizing the importance of their high VI rating seems even more like a bunch of hokum, and that getting a good lubricating oil with good anti foaming properties and long term stability would be a lot more important than high viscosity index, at least for street bike forks:\n\n\nIs there something I am missing here? Because the more I look into this the more I think I should just ignore \"fork oil\" for my street bike and just grab something like Mobil1 0W-8 which has a cst of 23 @40C or about what is commonly referred to as 5wt-7wt fork oil, or Mobil1 0W-16 which has a cst of 39.5 @40C or about what is commonly referred to as 7wt-10wt fork oil.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Fork oil differences besides viscosity?","Author":"Joel_The_Mole","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/fork-oil-differences-besides-viscosity.253437/","Date":"2024-03-17","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"Hi all, I got a 2008 Hyosung Aquila GV250 about a month ago as my first bike and I've found the battery completely drained after a recent ride. I live in the city center so my rides are relatively short, stop-go, and I had never gone above 60kmph, but I've never had any issues with the battery draining until now. This past weekend I went on the motorway for the first time and then straight into a very windy and hilly route that ranged between 60-80kmph. I had my high beams on for the second half, but definitely had the lights switched off while stopped at my destination. On the way back, we pulled over and I found that I couldn't start the bike again (ignition switch did nothing, not even an attempt to roll over) and when I checked, the battery level checker I have installed was flashing red, despite having the charged the bike to full that morning. I have since charged it to full again and resumed my inner city driving with no issues.\n\nThe battery was replaced a little over a year ago, so I'm wondering if it may be the stator or R/R. Is it possible that the constant high beam was too much for the charging system to supply? Or that the more intensive roads heated up the plastic wire jackets causing a loose connection? I've picked up a multimeter and am planning on following electrosport's charging fault flowchart to investigate this weekend, but interested in other's thoughts.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß","Title":"Hyosung Aquila GV250 battery completely drained while riding","Author":"Rachel C","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/hyosung-aquila-gv250-battery-completely-drained-while-riding.253365/","Date":"2024-03-05","Tags":["battery care","hyosung aquila"]}

{"Content":"Yesterday I was out for a nice 50 mile, one hour ride. I chose to take my CanAm Spyder because it was so windy with gusts at about 45 mph. With 3 wheels and about 1,000 pounds of weight, the Spyder does very well despite the strong cross winds, but I had to keep my helmet visor fully closed because open it felt like it might get snapped off in the high winds. Despite the bright sun and the high temps, not too many bikes were on the road, and those that were seemed to all be going quite slowly. I think I passed more two wheelers yesterday than I have on any recent ride. I assume that with 2 wheels the wind was having even more of an effect than it did for me on 3 wheels.\n\nAnother area where the Spyder seems less affected by wind than on regular motorcycles is when exposed to the wind blast of large trucks heading in the opposite direction on two lane roads. I always try to move as far to the right as is reasonable to try to offset the push of the wind blast, but with the Spyder do not feel a need to do anything. The passing trucks just do not bother me at all. In fairness I have to say that my new Royal Enfield Hunter 350 does not seem overly affected by passing trucks even though it is not a powerful bike, lightweight at 400 pounds and of course, has 2 wheels. I think that this is due to not having a windscreen. This is the first bike that I have owned in decades without a windscreen , and I think that this is why I am not feeling much of the wind blast from the trucks.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Three wheels in the wind","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/three-wheels-in-the-wind.253357/","Date":"2024-03-04","Tags":[]}

Whenever I turn it on, even after some minutes, at around 5-6k rpm it stutters very badly. After some time, it runs perfectly. It's worth mentioning that I think the stuttering sound is coming from the box the airfilter is in. Also, I think this happens more when the weather is cold, but still I have symptoms like: poor acceleration (especially uphill), and low mileage. Could it be the airfilter? (who seems pretty clean) or the fuel system?\nAlso, it seems that this happens at a fixed number of rpms, thats what making me believe it could be something electrical/ECU related. What do you think?

{"Content":"Most of the time I just feel like going for a ride. Just to have the experience of being out in the elements on my bike, even if it is just riding on very familiar roads for an hour and then returning home. But some days that doesn't seem like enough to motivate me to get the bike out of the garage. I feel like I need a destination.\n\nWhen my wife rides as my passenger, we often go for lunch with a ride of an hour or two hours, then a leisurely lunch, then an hour or two hours ride home. That makes for an almost perfect day for me. But going for lunch has less appeal if I am riding alone. Sometimes I decide to run an unnecessary errand to a location a half hour or more away, just to have a destination to head to.\n\nMotorcycling has been such a major factor in my life for so long that it sort of scares me to think about what I would do if at some point I am just not motivated to ride at all. But not today. Its supposed to be clear skies and about 75 degrees this afternoon, albeit with windy conditions, and even if I just stick to local roads I'm looking forward to getting out on one of my bikes.\n\nJust a Sunday morning musing.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Need a destination or just out for a ride?","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/need-a-destination-or-just-out-for-a-ride.253345/","Date":"2024-03-03","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"I picked up a neglected 85 XJ700 last fall. The factory Hitachi carbs are beyond repair. I thoroughly cleaned and attempted to rebuilt them by the book, But I believe they are too far gone. With the clean rebuilt stock carbs installed, new battery and fresh gas gravity feed from separate test tank, the bike cranks no start and every now and then a fire ball is visible at exhaust tip.\nI have a pristine set of 4 Mikuni BSR32SS carbs off of a 98-06 Suzuki GSX600F Katana, that I would like to run on the XJ700.\nThe problem I have is the current intake boots do not line up with the Spacing of the Mikuni carbs.\nI have been searching for different intake boots and I found a few that may work ( Kawasaki zx750 zephyr, Yamaha xj900f, Suzuki GS850 intake boots) based on 32mm carb side port, xj750 head port size , orientation (/ / \\ \\)and fastener hole spacing. The unknown variable that I am eyeing and guessing is the amount of offset needed the get the spacing correct. There is not a lot of technical info on intake boots making it difficult to choose a set that will work. I will post all the known center to center port spacing, carbs and head, as soon as I find my notes or remeasure. There has to be a more scientific, accurate way to figure this out aside from trial and error by firing the parts cannon at it with boots that look like they might fit.\nI also considered keeping the stock boots and buying flexible adapters. This could work but the adapters would have to be very short because space is limited.

One is showroom condition with only 2563 original miles, the other is in Very Good condition with only 13,068 miles.\nThe first one looks like it just rolled off the showroom floor. The gentleman who owned it is an Irishman with little mechanical knowledge and he did an oil change himself, only problem is, he forgot to add new oil and locked this one up after riding it a couple miles...\nThe other is in really nice shape with more miles on it and more signs of wear and tear, but it has been well cared for and needed the carbs rebuilt and here is where the issue comes in...\nThe first bike I found all internal parts and pieces with all of the bolts and pistons with rods and rings, all of the timing chains and chain tensioners as well as an oil pump and pick up, the coolant piece that holds the thermostat as well as all kinds of electrical and mechanical bits to repair the seized engine.\nThe second bike, I did it to myself and I am not proud of what I did, but I did it and I will admit it... The carbs were gone through by me and I added fuel and allowed it to run for quite a while, brought the temp up to normal and thought it was all good. However after installing the fuel tank and adding about a half a gallon of fuel, the rear carb float was not right and I hydrolocked the engine...\nI'm a mechanic for decades and was the shop forman in a Cadillac, Rolls Royce, Bentley dealership on the north shore of Chicago for years, I am also quite knowledgeable about Honda and Kawasaki road bikes, I was an Iron Butt rider and did 1000 mile days for years...\nSo, I pulled the plug and spun the engine over and fuel squirted out, but I thought it needs to spit more out and when I did the second spin over the dang thing blew more fuel out and you know what happened then...\nSo, now I am repairing and replacing anything that had fire damage, which in the grand sceme of things is VERY little. But I need the petcock knob which got a little melted and I have already found a seat cover and wiring harness bits which were slightly melted, but I learned my lesson... I cannot believe that I did that!\nI have a 1975 Honda CB 750 F Super Sport that has only 8218 miles on it from new.

{"Content":"Hi all, new to CBRs and the forums. I recently bought a 1988 Honda Hurricane 600 and and am trying to diagnose an issue I am having with the front brakes. I originally rode the bike back 250 miles with no issues, only to struggle here in town with my brakes seeming to heat lock. It only takes a few blocks for them to start self applying and getting very hot.\n\nAs I did not struggle with this issue on the way home, that makes me believe that it is not the brake lever, and that it is properly adjusted. I did find a seized piston in the front right caliper, replaced it, and am still having this issue. After R&R the caliper, I took it out to test and the same issue occurred. The fluid is obviously over pressurized, as when I cracked the bleeder screw, it shot fluid out. The caliper is very hard to compress, and I am unable to do it by hand. To me (very green to bikes so would love some help), that leaves two possible causes:\n\nA) The compensating port in my master cylinder is bad and not allowing fluid to return to the reservoir to reduce pressure while fluid expands from getting hot.\nB) My brake line is splintering internally and acting as a check valve, allowing fluid to run towards the caliper but not back\n\nBefore I order parts, is there a way I could test to see if it was either of those, and if not, which one would you all think most likely to be the culprit here?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nHonda","Title":"Honda Hurricane Brakes Locking Up","Author":"Scrongle","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/honda-hurricane-brakes-locking-up.253333/","Date":"2024-03-01","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"Hey there,\nDon't get mad from the title for a start\n\nI am currently living in Greece and I ride a Honda Steed 400, which I bought for 2k, Harleys here go for around 6-7k for a nice sportster.\n\nI am having a debate with myself considering whether I should upgrade my Honda Steed and spend around 1 to 1.5k maximum, to change the engine and make it look better as well, or just be a bit patient and get a Harley which is a dream of mine.\n\nHarley pros and cons:\nIt's a Harley\nI will be able to cruise much more comfortably since my Steed is going at 120/130 klm per hour tops, which is frustrating when I ride on open roads\nI will have to spend more money to maintain it, but my question here is how much more...\nI will be a bit stressed every time I take it off to work and stuff since in Greece they tend to steal a lot (usually though they don't mess with Harleys, but overall you never leave your motorcycle out of sight here)\nRiding into town for work etc won't be the most comfortable thing since the streets and traffic here are pretty bad\n\nHonda Steed\nIt feels better to ride it into town and leave it unattended sometimes since I am not afraid that someone is going to mess with it, also it feels a lot better to drive through traffic without worrying that something will happen to it, In general, I don't worry about anything since it's not such expensive in a way...\nIt is uncomfortable to drive into big highways since I feel it has no power... I do a 100klm trip and I feel like it's about to explode even if I stop like 2 times to give it a rest.\nI suppose that fixing it is also cheaper\n\nMy current state is that I live in Greece as I mentioned and let's say I make 1k per month... Considering that I buy the Harley, will I be able to maintain it?\nAlso from what I hear, Harleys tend to \"break\" more often than a honda steed, I don't know whether that's true or not, but I don't have the comfort of staying without my bike for more than a day (let's say I have to leave it to the mechanic or whatever)\nAlso, I would like to note that I don't care about the weather, I ride even if it is pouring rain like hell... (Although if I get the Harley I think that I will stop doing that, which will be a hustle for me..\nFinally, I am talking about a used Sportster from the 1990s, yes that costs from 6k to sometimes even 12-13.\n\nI understand that reading this can be very frustrating for you Harley Riders, but I want to consider everything since I will have to spend all of my savings doing a move like that...

{"Content":"I have a Kawasaki KZ440 LTD. I've been losing spark when riding causing me to go to the side of the road and struggle to get the bike to start again. I took off the tank and checked all wiring and found nothing suspicious. I replaced the coli, igniter and pickup coil and still the bike quits at random. Might be 50 feet or 5 miles before it quits. Yesterday in my garage I tried to start the bike but it wouldn't start. Not a peep out of it but it ran the day before. I checked my spark plug wires with my meter. I found one of the wires was dead or open...no reading with the meter. I checked further and found that the plug cap was open. Should have had 5k ohms with it as it's a resistor cap. I used a spark tester on the other cylinder and had no spark there. I thought the bike could start on one cylinder. I purchased a new cap and installed it and the bike started immediately and idles good. Haven't taken it out for a ride to test it yet due to the weather. My question....Would that bad cap kill the spark on the other cylinder? Had no spark on the second cylinder until I replaced the cap on the first cylinder. The coil is one that has the two leads going to it causing the plugs to fire at the same time. My question.....Do both plugs have to have a ground in order for the bike to run? I thought I read somewhere where they do but I can't find it.

{"Content":"Yesterday I read a news article about Ann Margaret still riding her Harley at 82 (Ann, not the Harley). I think that's great, and she was also great in my eyes (especially because of her commitment to those of us in the military) but I don't really think it is that remarkable that she is still riding. I'm almost 81 and ride and hope to be doing so for many more years. After my ride yesterday I stopped to fill up the 3 gallon gas tank on my new Royal Enfield Hunter 350 when a older gentleman in motorcycle clothing came around the gas pump to look at my bike. He assumed it was an old vintage British bike when he saw the RE logo, and seemed surprised when I told him that it is now an Indian company and that the bike was brand new. Since he looked even older than me I had to ask him how old he is and what was he riding. He was on a 2023 Harley cruiser (pretty bike, for sure) and told me that he is 86! I told him that he's my new hero, and wished him a safe ride.\n\nMaybe years ago there weren't so many older riders. I have met many who told me that they had been riders but had given it up due to age and physical issues, and often the person saying this was much, much younger than I am. Maybe its the result of modern medicine that people my age can still comfortably ride motorcycles even if they, like me, gave up a really heavy bike and went to something lighter.\n\nSo I still like Ann Margaret, and I'm glad she's riding, but I don't think its really that special.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Riding in your 80's is not so special","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/riding-in-your-80s-is-not-so-special.253315/","Date":"2024-02-28","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"So, I don't know if it's a stator or battery issue, but cold starting my bike, is has a slow crank. Once it warms up, it's better, but still not as fast as it should be. I hook up my battery charger, and it has a fast crank. The battery is new, but the previous owner kept the bike outside. So, I don't know if it messed up the stator. I have also been thinking it might need the carbs tuned. I haven't tested the voltage to the battery with everything off and running. I can give updates when I get that done, but and advice would be much appreciated.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß","Title":"98 Intruder LV1500","Author":"zwildefur","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/98-intruder-lv1500.253309/","Date":"2024-02-27","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"Hey all, I bought a 1984 Kawasaki ZN750 Shaft drive from a scrap yard for like $250, it was missing the carburetors. So instead of spending a few hundred on a rack from eBay, I went to my local Cycle Salvage and found a set of carbs that were 'close enough', but turns out they don't have vacuum ports (as far as I can tell), and this bike has a vacuum operated petcock (I also want to do a carb sync).\n\nSo my question is, can anyone advise if I can add a vacuum port by drilling into the carb body and adding a barb? I think that's what this spot is for (see pic), however that would put my vacuum line behind the throttle butterfly. Will I get enough vacuum there to run the petcock and do a carb sync?\n\n\nAnother suggestion was to use this passed from the back of the carb, but looking at it, I think it's interrupted by the choke plunger, so would only have vacuum with the choke open?\n\n\nAny suggestions or info would be appreciated, thanks!!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nBuilding, Restoration & Modification","Title":"Adding Vacuum port to Carburetor","Author":"Narsil","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/adding-vacuum-port-to-carburetor.253803/#post-2767850","Date":"2024-05-01","Tags":["carburetor","modification","vacuum"]}

Anytime i try and start it it either doesn't start at all and just clicks or will turn over and idle for a few seconds then die again, spraying starter fluid in the airbox makes it turn over more often but it will still die after a few seconds even with the choke fully on. so far I've tested the spark which is working fine and I've fully rebuilt the carbs which were weirdly clean for sitting for god knows how long.

I told him we could take it apart and clean/rebuild it, but he just bought another one for under $40.

{"Content":"Hello everyone, first time bike owner here, and I just purchased a 2008 Suzuki GSX650F. It needs new fairings and the previous owner did some unorthodox wiring when installing custom LED lights (which have been removed before purchase) but mechanically it functions beautifully. Or it did at least.\n\nI was aware when I bought it that it would need an oil change. My friend helped me drive it from the seller to my place (about 90 miles) and he had no issues, said it ran beautifully and wishes he could ride it more. I then put about another 20-30 practicing while waiting on my paycheck to get the new oil and filter. It ran perfect.\n\nI got 4 quarts of Lucas 10w40 Synthetic Motorcycle Oil and a K&M filter designed for this bike. I went home, drained the old oil, and removed the filter. After letting it all drip out, I put in 3.5 quarts (online says 3.7 is capacity but I've also read putting a tiny bit less is safer then putting a tiny bit more so I leaned on the lower side. The oil is just below the F line) all after filling the oil filter about halfway and installing that. Cleaned up the bike, turned it on and it started right up. Let it run about 10 minutes then got on and took it for about 2 miles away, turned around, and about 1.8 miles back the engine stalled. Turned right back on, got it home, did some quick runs around my house and it was fine.\n\nNext morning I turned it on, no issue, pulled in the clutch and shifted into first and the bike leaped forward and stalled. Tried again, same result. Tried again from first gear, the starter pushed the bike forward but didn't start. Like the clutch isn't disengaging. The digital gear indicator will go 1,N,2 but if I try to shift to 3 (with the bike off) the screen blanks and it doesn't sound like it's shifting properly. I also noticed once the bike warmed up that it was bogging a bit when in idle, and if I revved to anything above 5k and let off the throttle it stalled about half of the time.\n\nI redid the entire oil change with new oil AND filter and nothing. I even brought it to the F line and still have the issue. It's got a hydraulic clutch so I can't even seem to find help on how to adjust it, as I have read that it is common after a oil change to need to do that. Honestly I can't find anything about this bike except a few botched videos in YouTube.\n\nI would appreciate any advice or help anyone may be able to provide. This has me very irritated and is leaving me with a sour taste, but I know it is fixable so in trying to keep a clear head. Thank you all!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nüèç Motorcycle Forums üèç\nSportsbike Forum","Title":"GSX650F shifting stuck after oil change, help?","Author":"RyanM8640","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/gsx650f-shifting-stuck-after-oil-change-help.253257/","Date":"2024-02-19","Tags":["clutch","gsx650f","oil change"]}

{"Content":"Hello, I just joined the forum. I recently bought a 1981 Suzuki GS250T with 2458 miles on it. Although it has low miles, time has taken a toll, especially to the rubber and aluminum parts. Someone in the past even welded patches on the exhaust pipes where condensation probably ate holes in them, but they didn't smooth out the welds. All the lights and signals work though, so we settled on a reasonable price. I trailered it home because, although the seller put a new front tire on it two weeks before I bought it, the rear tire has cracks all around the sidewall. Finding a 3.50 x 17 tire was a challenge, but Duro still makes one, which I've ordered. The seller bought the bike 20 years ago to teach his wife, but that never happened, so it mostly sat, and he only rode it occasionally. The seller said he flushed out the fuel tank and cleaned the carbs last summer, and the gas in the tank is from then. He never changed the spark plugs, so they're 20+ years old. It will start, but it is very cold blooded and even warm it will not idle without the choke. It will rev if the throttle is slowly rolled on but will bog with faster throttle applications. Obviously, I will drain the fuel and replace it with fresh and change the plugs. Beyond that, I feel the carbs are the problem. They are Mikuni BS30 SS. I have not been able to locate a rebuild kit for them yet. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nSuzuki","Title":"Just bought a 1981 Suzuki GS250T that needs some help","Author":"goofyfoot53","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/just-bought-a-1981-suzuki-gs250t-that-needs-some-help.253259/","Date":"2024-02-19","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"Hello. Due to the needs of the technical inspection in my country I had to replace the turn signal with a turn signal with European markings. I replaced it and I did not like the frequency of blinking and also I noticed that it flows twice. On the seller's page it says about a relay with a regulator I ordered it I put it on and it's better, I can adjust the frequency as I need. But the double flows are still there. The polarity is correct, the relay is correct, the only thing I suspect is the resistors. Maybe someone has encountered such a thing and can give some advice. I would like to note that before replacing the relay and turn signals, there was no such thing. Maybe it's not the motorcycle system itself, but the turn signals themselves?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß","Title":"LED double flow issue","Author":"Jocker","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/led-double-flow-issue.253258/","Date":"2024-02-19","Tags":["flowing","led light","led turn signal","turn signal"]}

{"Content":"Hello everyone,\n\nI bought my motorcycle a few months ago probably in June 2023 and it has never truly idled properly. I stalls on me quite frequently. I don‚Äôt ride it a lot for this reason, but I am not sure how to fix it and make it idle smoothly.\nI recently pulled out the carburetor and cleaned the jets, I added new spark plugs cause those went bad as well and I got a new battery installed. I can start the bike and when I have the choke all the way out it‚Äôll idle just fine. If I put the choke back in, it dies on me, unless I‚Äôm pulling the throttle. I can ride it just fine usually, but anytime I come to a stop or near stop it dies. So now it dies anytime I‚Äôm standing still on it.\nHas anyone had these issues before? Should I mess with the idling PMS screws? I would do this, but they are capped off and this makes me believe the manufacturer doesn‚Äôt want them to be accessed. Should I clean the carburetor again?\nAnother interesting thing I found is that the throttle cable screw was all the way loose and held in place by a zip tie‚Ä¶ not sure what that was about but hopefully it gives some extra info.\nAnything helps, I just want to get it running smoothly hopefully.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nYamaha","Title":"2013 Yamaha V Star 650 not Idling Properly","Author":"Fonsi98","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/2013-yamaha-v-star-650-not-idling-properly.253239/","Date":"2024-02-15","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"This thing is geared ridiculously low. About 75 mph or so at 4,000 rpm. Redline starts around 10. Taking off in 2-3 on this thing is about the same as taking off in first on my 600 GSXR. I'm a curious guy. WHY ? Is it emissions to keep the breadbox cat hot ? Is it to make the bike feel more nimble around town ? It's a technological marvel but kind of silly in some ways. Why would a sport cruiser with the emphasis on sport be geared like that ? And the gearbox is closely spaced. In some gears I'm only dropping around 500 rpm's. It deff tends to make me go slower. That's a good thing. You hammer it you better be ready to shift. It winds out quick. Not really complaining, I'll change sprockets. Some have added two teeth up front AND taken one or two off the back. That's gonna help greatly on take off, and at highway cruising, but in between those two points it'll feel the same.\n\nWith the key on and the bike not started it makes a very quiet beeping noise. You'd never hear it with the bike on. Thought it was pretty cool. I get on the Ninja forumes...Nope. No One Nothing. One guy says it sounds like it might be an apple air-pod. I google the sounds they make, yep, it's an air-pod being powered up. (must be hard wired to the ignition) Text the previous owner, yep. Says he sticks them on everything and forgot about it. I wonder. Guy seems like he has way better things to do than track my bike. but who knows. I said I'd mail it back to him once I got it off.....","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Semi Interesting observations on my 2020 Ninja SX","Author":"Joey Bones","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/semi-interesting-observations-on-my-2020-ninja-sx.253797/","Date":"2024-04-30","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"FZ6R overheating and low coolant light\nI have a 2009 Yamaha FZ6R and I‚Äôve recently encountered a problem with overheating. The low coolant light came on while i was on my way home from University and the temps went over normal operating conditions, so I changed the coolant and bled out all the air but the issue persisted. I checked the water pump and it was working when I turned on the bike. I was told maybe it was a head gasket issue, but a car mechanic friend told me the coolant would be either mixing into my oil or smoke would be coming form the engine and I checked oil and it was fine, also no smoke was ever coming from the bike. I ended up changing the thermostat and it didn't fix the problem. I checked fans and they kick in around 200 degrees F. The old coolant looked good. The radiator has no cracks and none of the hoses are leaking coolant. At this point I'm lost on what to do.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß","Title":"FZ6R overheating issue","Author":"Ascension","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/fz6r-overheating-issue.253208/","Date":"2024-02-10","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"Hi,\nThe speedometer on my Kawasaki has been acting up for quite a while. It sometimes jumps all over the place never showing a correct or clear speed but most of the times it shows zero. This bike uses the ABS sensors to measure speed! I've measured both sensors, which show the same resistance. Replaced the rear one which didn't change anything.\nWhat i've figured out is that if i unplug the front sensor, drive a few meters and then plug it back in it works fine as long as the ignition doesn't turn off for more than a few seconds. I will try to ride for an extended time tomorrow to rule out bad connections as the problem. Seeing as the bike clearly knows the speed, but refuses to display it to me (and doesn't count towards the odometer) i'm thinking it's a ECU fault, but i have minimal experience with those parts of a bike. Would love opinions and possible solutions, or more ways to troubleshoot, things to check for!\nBike is 2020 Z125 (not pro version)\nThanks!\n\nDifferent sensor combinations:\nFront only, works if unplugged and replugged if ignition is on.

{"Content":"Hi. New to this forum and I don't have a huge knowledge on bikes so I am looking for some advice on a 125cc scooter for my daughter. She has been riding an 50cc for a couple of years and is confident in city riding (lives and works around Brighton) My main question is what are everyone's thoughts on a brand new cheaper 125, such as a Sinnis Connect versus a higher end brand that is 3-5 years old with say 2-3k miles? She has about ¬£1700 to spend and can get a new Sinnis with 7 year warranty for that, but has also seen a Peugeot Tweet 2018 with 3k miles for the same price. Private sale, 1 owner, well looked after. Should she go for a new cheaper brand, or an older better brand?

{"Content":"I'm planning on taking a motorcycle road trip in late Spring or early summer, by myself and with no specific time limit to be away from home. I'm getting older, and will be turning 81 about the time I can leave, and feel like this well might be the last such trip I will get to make. I plan on heading west from where I live in Rockford, IL and get at least as far as the Black Hills area in South Dakota, visiting Crazy Horse, Mt. Rushmore, the Badlands and maybe Devils Tower in Wyoming.\n\nMy question for anyone who knows this route is, would it be a good ride to just take U.S. 20 straight west until mid Nebraska, then head north to the Black Hills. I really don't want to use the Interstates, but not sure that U.S. 20 would be any more scenic or interesting. Options would be to either head north into Minnessotta before heading West, or south and then come across Iowa and into Nebraska before heading north. But again, I would prefer to avoid the Interstates.\n\nAny suggestions or advice? I had hoped to have some company for the trip but my old riding friends are either dead, given up riding or just not up to a long road trip.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Midwest road trip","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/midwest-road-trip.253175/","Date":"2024-02-04","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"Hey guys, got a weird one here, looking for some insight perhaps. Please keep in mind, I am a beginner motorcyclist, but I am trying my best to learn how to ride AND maintain these amazing machines!\nJust traded a 2002 Honda Shadow 750 Spirit to a kid who was getting rid of a 2001 Yamaha R1 1000. Apparently it was too fast for him and he really just wanted a cruiser, okay. Bike has a few cosmetic dings, nothing I'm worried about, and also needs a new battery (The current one is so bad that headlights don't even stay consistently bright during a drive, and you cannot start without a jump), which is only gonna run 50 dollars. However, one thing he said was that the previous owner had put an aftermarket slip-on exhaust on the bike, and now the \"bike needs a tune up to unlock the full power of the bike\", which sounded like dookie to me.\nHaving 0 experience with slip-on's, i decided to test the bike, and god does it have no power! If I attempt to get the bike going from a standstill at anything lower then 5k RPM, the bike will almost certainly stall if i don't pull the clutch immediately, and even moving in first gear, wide open throttle, RPM's increase very slowly and it can take up to 10-20 seconds just to get to 70-ish MPH. At some point the RPM's can reach redline, and at some point I can exceed 100 MPH or more, but there ain't no way this is caused by a simple slip-on, I'm not that dense.\nTomorrow morning I am going to pull the slip-on off and do a quick test, see if it ACTUALLY has that kind of impact, but on the chance that I am right and its not the exhaust, what could possibly be doing this to this poor bike? Part of me wants to assume it is related to the clutch because acceleration is so poor, but at the same time if it was the clutch, the RPM's would go up but speed wouldnt.. right?\nAny and all help is appreciated. Thank you guys so much!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß","Title":"01 Yamaha R1; needs high RPM to get rolling and has very poor acceleration/torque","Author":"RyanM8640","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/01-yamaha-r1-needs-high-rpm-to-get-rolling-and-has-very-poor-acceleration-torque.253795/","Date":"2024-04-29","Tags":[]}

My last ride was a month around Puerto Rico in January. Have ridden in all 6 rideable continents and 38 countries. Often one or both of my daughters traveled with me. I have a RE Himalayan, a KLR650 and a Sportster 48. All are heavily customized to accommodate my needs such as back rest, heel and toe shifter, windshield, aftermarket seats and 3 point lighting front and back for all.\nI have two questions for anyone who knows and would like to enlighten me.\n#1 will I have any trouble buying this bike and insuring in the UK at my age?\n#2 have read various reports on windshields for the Cub and a number of people have mentioned flex in a negative way because of illdesigned mounting. If you have a windshield and it works great for you I'd like to know please\nFortunately I have family in Kent so I will be storing it with them after the trip and it'll be ready for the next ride. Right now I'm interested in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. This trip will be to Scandinavia so if you have any relevant info I'd be happy to hear it. All my trips have been on secondary roads.

{"Content":"Hi all\nI am new to motorcycle maintenance, and recently did a some work on my Honda cbf250 front fork.\nI stripped the fork down and disassembled to fix leaking fork oil seals.\n\nOne of the forks went down no problem, however the second damper retension bolt got stripped managed to get the bolt off by using a size up imperial Alan, which actually seems to get good purchase.\n\nI stripped the fork and replaced the seals. This is where I get uncertain.\n\nim going on a long trip (2 days ride, 11 hours) tommorow, and due to the time constraint, decided not to replace the bolt. I couldn‚Äôt torque it due to lack of imperial Alan sockets, but I tightened it quite tight (aiming for about the same tension I applied to the other fork tube using a torque wrench) and applied blue lock tight. It feels pretty bomb, I think I could get it out currently, but it wouldn‚Äôt be super easy tightness wise.\n\nbasically I‚Äôm wondering:\n\nA: would people think it‚Äôs likely for this bolt to loosen? My mate said stripped bolts tension unreliably, which makes me worried about the bolt loosening. I feel like it‚Äôs tight enough, if anything I‚Äôd be concerned about over tightening, but I‚Äôm new so unsure.\nB: if it did loosen, how dangerous would that be?\nI don‚Äôt care if it would cause damage, damage can be fixed. But I don‚Äôt want to lose my front wheel at 100 km/h.\n\nI'm currently planning on seeing if I can find a replacement bolt anywhere around town and if I can I‚Äôll probably pull it and replace for peace of mind, but if that fails I‚Äôd like to guage risk?\nThanks,\nJames.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß","Title":"How dangerous is fork damper retention screw failure?","Author":"Jimhbean","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/how-dangerous-is-fork-damper-retention-screw-failure.253148/","Date":"2024-01-30","Tags":[]}

The scooter was picked up from the repair on January 17, 2024, and I was advised to keep it under 80 km/h for the first 1,000 kilometers, which I adhered to.\nEverything seemed fine for the first 466 kilometers, but then I encountered an issue when it was wet and raining; my scooter would shut off when slowing down or nearly stopping, as if the engine was choking.\nThe mechanic initially thought it was a loose connection in the air lifter intake to the engine and fixed it.\nHowever, the problem persisted.\n\nToday, after the plug was replaced, the issue occurred again on my way back home, and this time there was no rain or wet road (see attached video). I'm quite despaired as the repair cost me $2,500.\n\nHas anyone experienced a similar issue or could possibly pinpoint what might be causing this problem?\n\nAny advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!\n\nThank you in advance for your help!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nüèç Motorcycle Forums üèç\nüõµ Scooter Forum üõµ","Title":"Persistent Engine Shut Off Issue in Yamaha Xmax 400 (2018) After Crankshaft and Piston Replacement","Author":"MacGyver192","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/persistent-engine-shut-off-issue-in-yamaha-xmax-400-2018-after-crankshaft-and-piston-replacement.253118/","Date":"2024-01-25","Tags":[]}

I did a lot of research and hoped someone could confirm my game plan or help me with suggestions:\n1. Working on the chips. I would start sanding the rust out of them with 400 sand paper, apply a primer (if there are any recommended, please let me know). After letting it try for 2 hours I paint the holes in new color (I got a matching color online) and after letting that dry for another 2 hours I apply the clear coat.\n2. Working on scratches. I‚Äôll start with thoroughly cleaning the tank and use cleaning alcohol as last step. Then I use 1500 sandpaper (wet) and work on the areas that are scratched. Then I switch up to 2000 wet sandpaper and afterwards clean everything with cleaning alcohol again. I get a polish machine and use maquires ultimate compound to polish the entire tank. That should also fix the oxidation.\n3. Waxing. After 2 weeks of waiting I wax the entire tank.\nHappy about any recommendations, since I‚Äòve never done it before.

{"Content":"Hello, new rider here, have about 900km under my belt, passed my basic learners test, with about three weeks of riding in. FYI\n\nHave been trying to ride a variety of roads/freeways and build up some experience in all conditions.\n\nToday went for my longest ride and half way through it, was riding a very hilly area with some lovely turns. I noticed on a lot of corners on some of the roads that I took there were was a build of loose stones in the middle of my lane, both along the flat and around the corners. I was ok on the straight, managed to ride either side of it. However in a couple of turns, was lightly braking into the corner avoided the stones, but on one such corner there were stones in middle and my front wheel was under a light brake, however just started to slide as I came across it. Fortunately I wasn't going that fast throughout corner, I released the front brake, and the bike sat up and I managed to get through corner just, however it really shook me up. It was way too close to losing complete control and crashing.\n\nWhat can you do, when you are wide turning into a corner and notice stones in the middle of your intended line whilst braking (front only) across it. I saw the stones only in the turn late as they were shaded by over hanging large trees.\n\nLove any thoughts or suggestions on this.\nThanks Andy","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nMotorcycle Training, Safety, and Riding Techniques","Title":"New rider doing some twisties and nearly lost bike in corner with loose stones built up .

{"Content":"I'm new to riding, about 4 months now and recently I've been having this issue with my bike. It's a yamaha v-star 250 from 2012 with about 8100 km on it. I've been riding in cold weather so far anywhere from -2 to 8 degrees celsius. Had a similar issue with the motorcycle about 2 weeks ago when I was on my way to my friend's house (which is 50 km away) where it just died on a hill after spluttering and it would not start back up (it would start for about 10 seconds then it would just die). I got my friend who is a mechanic and we checked the air filters, changed the spark plugs, checked all connections and the battery then figured that after spraying starting fluid in the motorcycle it would come back to life, so he said that it's a big chance the carburetor jets are clogged (which they were), we took apart the motorcycle and fully cleaned the carburetor and there were a lot of jets that were clogged. After that the motorcycle ran perfectly and I drove the 50km back to my home with no problems in 1 degree weather. Fast forward to now 2 weeks later and I'm having issues again, I was on the way to my university today when the motorcycle just started spluttering then it just straight up died in the middle of the road. Had to go on the sidewalk and try to start it back up again. Wouldn't start but after a few minutes of trying it started back up with the choke, then i lowered the choke and it ran fine. After that I decided to try to make it to my university which was only 1 km left away and just as i was about to reach it, the motorcycle died again. Spluttered and then died. Did the same thing, went on the side and had the motorcycle run on full choke. This time the RPMS were getting really high, then getting really low, and it would do this for a few minutes until it just came back to life and sounded normal. After that I went to park it. When I got back to my motorcycle (2 hours later) I started with the choke full (everything fine) warmed it up for 5 minutes until I could feel the heat coming from the side and left with bike. 3 minutes later it just died again the same way it died previously, this time after starting it back up it would do the same thing, splutter then die when coming to a stop sign. Somebody came by and tried to help me with the bike, we adjusted the idling speed of the bike and turned it to the right. Did not help. He also told me that he has a carburetor bike as well and has the same problem when riding in cold weather. Got any ideas what this could be? any help would be appreciated\n\nAlso I would like to mention that every time I go out riding in the rain my motorcycle start having the same issues, it seems to splutter and then die at low rpm in the rain. Fuel pump was not opened up and cleaned, we did take the line off and cranked it and it did push out fuel at a steady rate. The motorcycle did not sit in garage for longer than 1-2 days when it was snowing, I've gone out with the motorcycle pretty much every single day if it didn't snow.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß","Title":"Motorcycle starts spluttering then dying when starting from a full stop","Author":"AndreiScheianu","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/motorcycle-starts-spluttering-then-dying-when-starting-from-a-full-stop.253036/","Date":"2024-01-13","Tags":[]}

I had a theory that oil was getting into the rear cylinder some how, so I took the junction off the exhaust system and left two wide open pipes for me to confirm that the rear cylinder is the culprit for the smoke, and the front for the backfires.\n\nWhat I discovered was exactly that, but also that the rear cylinder isn't even firing.

Then I took the head off of the rear cylinder and this is what I found.\n\n\n\n\nIf I'd only had been working with daylight instead of garage lights when I was adjusting the valves I'd have probably noticed the discoloration even with the valve spacer where it was. I was only expecting bad piston rings, and I didn't get look into that further; not that it matters since I've already got two sets of the oem piston rings on the way. I've decided that I'm just gonna replace all the gaskets from the bottom-most gaskets on up, replace both pistons' rings, and, now, I guess that I'm replacing the exhaust valves and cleaning the valve seats. I don't know. I haven't been able to inspect it further, except from the pictures and from the discoloration I can tell that one exhaust valve in particular is responsible\n\nWhat I'm interpreting from all of this is that combustion is getting into the valve chamber. So that means that valves were stuck open during combustion. Or, that oil is coming up from the piston rings and is mucking up the combustion by soaking and interfering with the spark plugs, which leads to leftover gasoline getting up into the valve chamber and burning up in there?

{"Content":"Hello, I live in Istanbul / Turkey. I bought a street triple 675 last week. 2016 model. I bought the engine cheaply, but of course there are some shortcomings and since the euro rate is high, I want to do it myself as much as I can.\n\n1- when the engine starts from the clutch, a sound similar to a friction sound comes from the clutch. I think this is a general problem in these motorcycles. do I need to change the clutch plate? when I squeeze the clutch lever, the sound goes away.\n\n2- sometimes the tachometer does not work but the blue warning light works. is this a socket problem?\n\n3- when I first bought it, the abs light was not on when I brought it to the garage, but this morning the abs light was blinking even though I started it and moved. is it related to the socket.\n\n4- Red liquid is flowing from a plastic reservoir next to the crankcase of the engine, similar to antifreeze.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nTriumph","Title":"2016 street triple ƒ±ssues.

{"Content":"Greetings all.\n\nLast summer, dipped my toe into the water by picking up a 1985 Virago 900 to see if I really wanted to get back into bikes. Well, the bike gods bit again so a few weeks ago, I picked up a 2019 Suzuki Boulevard c50T with only 1,000 miles on the dial. Put 500 miles on her in the last few weeks getting familiar with the bike and making the modifications we all make with a new purchase. Obviously, the Virago will go to the next custodian for future ownership.\n\nMods include replacing stock seat with a 2 up Saddlemen Explorer. Definitely improves the ride. LED headlight and turn signal upgrade, Kewig waterproof wireless cellphone charger/holder, wired for and purchased heated gloves (I live in the NJ so winter riding is cold), aftermarket luggage rack, Graber passenger Armrests, mechanical throttle lock, fork deflectors and windshield extender to eliminate buffeting at speed.\n\nHeres what I can say about the boulevard c50T. It's a good middleweight cruiser. Light enough to enjoy the twisties (650 lbs) and powerful enough to stay at 70-75 all day long. Much beyond that, the missing 6th gear becomes obvious and vibration introduces itself. Don't get me wrong, Im not dissing the bike. I get my speed fix on 4 wheels on racetracks in the warmer months so motorcycles north of 75 mph isn't necessary for me. I will say this - For relatively short money, I got into a bike I would have no problem doing 300 mile days (note previous seat upgrade. Wouldn't even attempt on stock seat). Much more than that, your gonna want a few hundred more cc's and a 6th gear at least.\n\nIm really looking forward to the weather breaking in a few months so the wife and I can head out for a few long weekends or even impromptu day trips.\n\nIf you've read this far, thanks for doing so.

{"Content":"Occasionally I need to use a cell phone or gps with gloves on which are not made to be capacitive screen friendly. I bought this stainless steel thread from Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079H26WBN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1. This thread can be sewn (even by those with no sewing talent) into the leather end of a finger on a glove. The idea is to make a mass of thread at the end of the finger that is on both the outside and inside surface of the glove finger. It will operate a capacitive screen, as on a gps or phone. I used a short section of 1/2\" PVC pipe to stuff into the glove finger to aid the sewing; it makes it easier to avoid accidentally sewing the finger too short. Probably a bad idea to try with heated gloves.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMOTORCYCLE GEAR\nGloves","Title":"Gloves, cell phones, GPS","Author":"etex","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/gloves-cell-phones-gps.252981/","Date":"2024-01-03","Tags":[]}

I can buy on credit if necessary.\nOn average I can spend up to MUR 150,000 (credit)\nDefinitely, not going above MUR 200,000 (credit)\n\nI have so many questions:\n1) Is it worth it to buy a motorcycle and to learn to ride with clutch?\nOr new motorcycles in the future will be automatic like the Yamaha PG-1 ?\nConsider that I will probably never ride a motorcycle above 300cc.\nI will prefer motorcycles that are around 150kg or less.\n\n2) Should I buy a scooter TVS Jupiter 125 (about MUR 100,000) ?\nI don't like scooters but since it is automatic, maybe it would be easier.\nNo offense, but in my mind, motorcycles are more manly.\n\nMotorcycles in my country that I like:\n1) Yamaha YBR125-ED(MUR 90,000) It probably is an old model still being sold.

{"Content":"Hi I'm Joe,\n\nBeen hooked on bikes since I was eight years old. I read a book in the school library called MINI BIKE CHALLENGE.\n\nFrom that day forth I was obsessed. I was fortunate enough to have parents who got me a beat up Broncco Diablo 4 years later on my 12th birthday. I jumped on and knew how to ride from practicing shifting on my bicycle. It was a pretty good first bike. Two stroke was great in the woods, 4 speed manual.\n\nAs I grew I bought a 1971 Honda SL 125 that was totally redone correctly for dirt. Next I had a 1979 CR125 that was one of the fastest bikes I've ever ridden for woods. It was only 2 years old and practically new.\n\nWhen I turned 18 I bought a two year leftover, 1981 XL500. It wasn't the greatest on the road or off but a lot of fun around town.\n\nThen I had an 81 shadow 500. What a fun quick versatile bike !!!!!\n\nFew years went by I bought a 2001 RM250 MX. Too fast for around my area, it was exhausting hanging onto that thing. No flow. Should have got another 125.\n\nThen I got into quads. Won a Wide Glide in a raffle. After less than a year I traded up to a Softail Heritage Classic. I can't say enough good things about that bike. It was like a mini bike for a full grown person. I rode days at a time on that, never sore.. just got tired of riding after a few years and got into other hobbies. Bought a Kawasaki Versys 650 off my brother. Had it for a year, sold it. It did nothing for me.\n\nNever had a race bike, bought a 2005 GSXR 600 last fall, it reignited my passion for riding again. Rode it WAY more than I thought it would.\n\nI kept it and bought a Ninja 1000 SX touring used a few weeks ago. It's similar to the GSXR but with creature comforts. All the tech, side hard bags. I can ride this bike all day long, take it on trips, run errands. It's my every day bike. Probably the last two bikes I'll own they are both great at what they were built for.\n\nHere's a pic of my 05 600 GSXR. No EPA emissions or computer ABS, traction control, it's not drive by wire. The last of a dying breed, it's a beast, redlines over 15,000 rpm, a true adrenaline machine...\n\n\n\nHere's a recent pic of my Ninja after putting the green accent stripes on the hard bags, I think they really set it off\n\n\n\nGood to be here, thanks for reading.\n\nJoe","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nüÜï New Member Introductions üÜï","Title":"Lifelong Rider, new member","Author":"Joey Bones","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/lifelong-rider-new-member.253782/","Date":"2024-04-28","Tags":[]}

It wasn't the greatest on the road or off but a lot of fun around town.\n\nThen I had an 81 shadow 500. What a fun quick versatile bike !!!!!\n\nFew years went by I bought a 2001 RM250 MX. Too fast for around my area, it was exhausting hanging onto that thing. No flow. Should have got another 125.\n\nThen I got into quads. Won a Wide Glide in a raffle. After less than a year I traded up to a Softail Heritage Classic. I can't say enough good things about that bike. It was like a mini bike for a full grown person. I rode days at a time on that, never sore.. just got tired of riding after a few years and got into other hobbies. Bought a Kawasaki Versys 650 off my brother. Had it for a year, sold it. It did nothing for me.\n\nNever had a race bike, bought a 2005 GSXR 600 last fall, it reignited my passion for riding again. Rode it WAY more than I thought it would.\n\nI kept it and bought a Ninja 1000 SX touring used a few weeks ago. It's similar to the GSXR but with creature comforts. All the tech, side hard bags. I can ride this bike all day long, take it on trips, run errands. It's my every day bike. Probably the last two bikes I'll own they are both great at what they were built for.\n\nHere's a pic of my 05 600 GSXR. No EPA emissions or computer ABS, traction control, it's not drive by wire. The last of a dying breed, it's a beast, redlines over 15,000 rpm, a true adrenaline machine...\n\n\n\nHere's a recent pic of my Ninja after putting the green accent stripes on the hard bags, I think they really set it off\n\n\n\nGood to be here, thanks for reading.\n\nJoe","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nüÜï New Member Introductions üÜï","Title":"Lifelong Rider, new member","Author":"Joey Bones","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/lifelong-rider-new-member.253782/#post-2767614","Date":"2024-04-28","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"Hi all,\n\nGot the bike out earlier after a break of a couple of months. Since it's a nice dry day I thought I'd run an errand from Chester to Ormskirk. But didn't realise it would be so windy...\n\nI sure did get a fright with some of those gusts of wind, especially on the M57 and M58. I checked the Met Office website afterwards and gust speeds in those areas were 39mph.\n\nI've experienced serious wind before (ho ho ho!) particularly in Scotland. One time I had really consistent side winds in open country and was leaning against it. Must've looked weird to the driver behind me. Another time experienced really strong gusts on the massive hill that leads down towards Perth (think it was there anyway).\n\nOn today's ride, I got hit by some nasty but random gusts. The first one took me a little by surprise and briefly altered my direction of travel. My response was to duck behind the screen more and make myself smaller, and keep the throttle up, although limited myself to more like 70mph. I also found that it helped to tense up my core and back muscles as if in a bracing posture for when the next hit came along, although some people say it is better to relax, I'm not so sure. I wanted to be in full control of how the handles and front wheel moved.\n\nWeirdly, by the time I was heading home on the M56 and dealing with more like 29mph winds, it seemed a doddle in comparison, although still a bit rough, and I had more of a \"**** yeeeaaaahh!!\" attitude.\n\nAnyway... feel free to share your stories and tips, and also... what is your limit when it comes to wind speed? At what point is it too dangerous?\n\nPs. Suzuki V Strom 650 in my case.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Your Wind Speed Limits?","Author":"Stromtrooper","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/your-wind-speed-limits.252922/","Date":"2023-12-23","Tags":[]}

{"Content":"I've never been tempted to go to Sturgis or Daytona for their motorcycle rallies. Just too big, too difficult to get motel reservations unless done far, far in advance, etc. Sturgis is always with broiling hot weather, and Daytona would mean trailering my bike that time of year to get there and back. But I used to go to other rallies, at least once a year. Back in the late '80's and early '90's there were the Rider magazine sponsored rallies which were always great fun. And then for many years I went to the Honda Hoot, but I think the last one was in 2009 which is now 15 years ago. For me the best part of the rallies was the chance to ride all sorts of bikes by the manufacturer demo rides available. One Honda Hoot that my youngest son attended with me, we rode at least a dozen different bikes each over the course of about 3 days, something I never would have had the chance to do otherwise. And going to a rally gave me a good destination for a long road trip each year.\n\nI had planned to go to a Wing Ding, but no sooner did I want to go when the whole Goldwing Road Riders Association went out of business and the Wing Dings along with it. A few years back I went to something called (if I recall correctly) \"The Thunder in the Smokies\" in Maggie Valley, NC and it was totally ****. No demo teams, very few vendors and absolutely nothing to make me glad to even spend the entry fee let alone the cost of an entire trip.\n\nAdd to this the endling of the annual Progressive sponsored motorcycle show each winter, and the end of almost all the motorcycle magazines, and I feel rather deprived. I wonder if now that we are past the big recession that started in 2008, past the COVID crisis, and seeing bike sales increasing (I think) that maybe we would see a return of the rallies. I assume Americade is still operating, but I have real problems going to NY for any reason.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Wonder if we will ever see a return to motorcycle rallies as we had just a few years back?","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/wonder-if-we-will-ever-see-a-return-to-motorcycle-rallies-as-we-had-just-a-few-years-back.253771/","Date":"2024-04-27","Tags":[]}
