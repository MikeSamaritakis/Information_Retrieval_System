# Information Retrieval System

This project's main idea is to create a web-crawler that will crawl a website and index its content into an ElasticSearch
database. The user can then search using queries and the search engine will return the most relevant results using TF-IDF 
weights and cosine similarity.

## How To Configure and Run the Project
*An IDE that supports Java, such as IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate, for testing this project IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate 2020.3 was used.*

**To run the project, you need to have the following installed:**

- Java JDK 17
- Maven 3.8.3 *(After everything is installed make sure to sync the project so that no dependency issues come up)*
- [ChromeDriver](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)
- [Selenium WebDriver](https://www.selenium.dev/downloads/)
- [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/elasticsearch)
- [Kibana](https://www.elastic.co/downloads/kibana)
- CURL for Powershell (optional)

**To run the searching you need to have the following installed:**

*Before running any configuration you must create an ENV_vars.java file in the src/ directory and add the following code:*
```java
public class ENV_vars {
    public static final String API_KEY = "your_api_key_to_kibana_here";
    public static final String chromedriver = "C:\\your_absolute_path_to_the_chromedriver_exe_file\\Web-Crawler\\chromedriver-win64\\chromedriver.exe";
}
// or alternatively use the commented code found in the WebCrawler.WebCrawler() function
```

The project is basically divided into three parts, the web-crawler, the indexing and the search engine.

*You have to run the ElasticSearch and Kibana services before running the project.*

You can do that using the following commands in the terminal after navigating to the proper directory: (for Windows)
```bash
elasticsearch-8.13.2/bin/elasticsearch.bat 
```
and when ElasticSearch is running, run the following command:
```bash
kibana-8.13.2/bin/kibana.bat
```
___
## Running the Project without GUI

**To run the web-crawler:** Either run the configurations found in the .idea/runConfigurations/WebCrawler.xml or run it using the terminal.

- The arguments for the Web-Crawler are as follows:
```bash
javac Main.java
``` 
and the command:
```bash
java Main  -WebCrawler
```
---
**To run the CRUD operations:**

*Before running the CRUD operations you have to create an index in Kibana and make sure that the field:*
```java
public class PublicVars {
    public static final String INDEX_NAME = "your_index_name_here";
    // rest of the public variables ...
}
```
- For **Create** Index: You have to create a post_data_id.json (i.e.: where id = 23) file and specify its path in the run configuration file. 
The file should look like this:
```json
[{
  "Content": "Hello, I have an old 2000 ZX6R I have been repairing. I've been riding recently and it ended up stalling out and it will not crank anymore. I think the stator/regulator are original, so I'm thinking they are the problem. Am I better off replacing both, or just the regulator as it is most likely blown?",
  "Breadcrumbs": "Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nüîß Motorcycle Repair üîß",
  "Title": "Stator/Regulator Replacement",
  "Author": "DVantage",
  "URL": "https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/stator-regulator-replacement.253850/",
  "Date": "May 6, 2024",
  "Tags": [
    "charging",
    "starting",
    "stator"
  ]
}]
```
The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

---
- For **Read** Index: You have to specify the index id in the run configuration file.

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

---

- For **Delete** Index: You have to specify the index id in the run configuration file.

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

---

**Then either edit and run the configurations found in the .idea/runConfigurations/ folder correspondingly or run it 
using the terminal with the following commands:**

- The arguments for the **Bulk Upload** Index are as follows:
```bash
javac Main.java
``` 
and the command:
```bash
java Main -BulkUpload
```

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

---

- The arguments for the **Create** Index are as follows: 
```bash
javac Main.java
``` 
and the command: 
```bash
java Main -CRUD -Create fileToJSON.json // where fileToJSON.json is the file path to the file you want to index
```

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

---

- The arguments for the **Read** Index are as follows: 
```bash
javac Main.java
```
and the command:
```bash
java Main -CRUD -Read postId // where postId is the id of the post you want to read
```

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

---

- The arguments for the **Delete** Index are as follows:
```bash
javac Main.java
```
  and the command: 
```bash
java Main -CRUD -Delete postId // where postId is the id of the post you want to delete
```

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

---

- The arguments for the **Update** Index are as follows: 
```bash
javac Main.java
``` 
and the command:
```bash 
```bash
java Main -CRUD -Update
```

But first you have to create a Json file that follows the format below and specify its filepath and id in the Main.java file: 
```json
{
  "doc": {
    "Content": "content",
    "Breadcrumbs": "Home\nForums\nüèç Motorcycle Forums üèç\nForum",
    "Title": "title",
    "Author": "username",
    "URL": "https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/example/",
    "Date": "2024-05-03",
    "Tags": ["updated"]
  }
}
```

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

---

**To run the search engine:** You have three options:

- For **Content Search**: Write the query you want in the Main.java file and then run the configuration file named Search Content.

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

- For **Title Search**: Write the query you want in the Main.java file and then run the configuration file named Search Title.

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

- For **Tags Search**: Write the query you want in the Main.java file and then run the configuration file named Search Tags.

The results of this operation will be found at the terminal.

- For **TF-IDF Search**: You have to run it using the GUI and the instructions found below regarding the GUI.

## Running the Project with GUI

**Note! All the results will appear in the terminal and NOT the UI.**

**Run the configurations found in the .idea/runConfigurations/GUI.xml or run using 
the terminal with the following commands:**

---

**To run the Web Crawler:** Simply press the button and let it finish running. It could take up to a few hours 
to finish depending on the website you are crawling, the hardware you are using and the internet speed.

---

**To run the CRUD operations:**

*Before running the CRUD operations you have to create an index in Kibana:
```bash
curl.exe -H "Authorization: ApiKey api_key_here" -X PUT  "http://locvalhost:9200/motorcycle_forum/" 
// or instead of motorcycle_forum use the name of your index
```
or alternatively use the Kibana Dev Tools to create an index:
```bash
PUT motorcycle_forum
{
  "mappings": {
    "properties": {
      "content": {
        "type": "text",
        "term_vector": 
      }
    }
  }
}
```
and make sure that the fields in PublicVars.java are set as follows:
```java
public class PublicVars {
    public static final String INDEX_NAME = "your_index_name_here"; // In this case "motorcycle_forum"
    // rest of the public variables ...
}
```
---
- For **Create** Index: You have to create a post_data_id.json (i.e.: where id = 23) file and specify its path in the window that pops up and click the create button.
  The file should look like this:
