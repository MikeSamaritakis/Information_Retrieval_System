{"Content":"I rode bicycles for years, did 3,000 miles on a bicycle one year.\nI've put about 500 miles on my motorcycle and another ~200 on my wife's.\nI see counter steering as a technique for motorcycle.\nPic from a thread that was closed:\nI get (understand) the pressure against the tank, on right, how that helps turn.\n\n\nI don't get why push the left handle bar to the right initially to go left, it is the opposite of the direction of the turn.\nI know doing this thread will out me as a novice (or remove any doubt); so, yesterday when going to pick up pizza on motorcycle I try pushing the handlebar in the opposite direction of what I want to turn and I see how it corrects itself. Okay. I don't see (understand) the advantage of doing that.\n\nI definitely have not been doing that on the motorcycle or bicycle.\nI have not been pushing the handle bar in the opposite direction of the direction I want to turn; I had to think about it to do it.\n\nI've watched videos on YT too and I don't get (understand) why or when the technique is used.\n\nI'm driven motorcycles around town about 700 miles and apparently I've been doing it without counter steering because I had to think to do it and I don't get when the strategy is used.\n\nI understand pressure against the gas tank.\nHelp me understand the when and/or why of counter steering because this novice doesn't get it and I'd like to eventually move beyond novice.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nMotorcycle Training, Safety, and Riding Techniques","Title":"Counter steering - explain the why / when of it to a novice.","Author":"CDW4ME","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/counter-steering-explain-the-why-when-of-it-to-a-novice.253493/#post-2764167","Date":"2024-03-23","Tags":[]}
