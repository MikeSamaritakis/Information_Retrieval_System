{"Content":"Hey so I posted a thread on the CB750 website and all I got was a bunch of angry boomers who nagged me about my question. Can I swap the engine from a 1979-1983 CB900 into a 1979-1983 CB750 chassis? Do the bolts swap right over into the 750 frame or are there clearance issues or bolt length problems? Thatâ€™s it. Context doesnâ€™t matter, just give me a straight answer please. Thanks.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"CB750 and CB900 Project","Author":"bigiron59","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/cb750-and-cb900-project.253205/","Date":"2024-02-10","Tags":["cb750","cb900","honda"]}
