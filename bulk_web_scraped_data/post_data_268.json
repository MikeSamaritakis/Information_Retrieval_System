{"Content":"This has been a strange year. Last Fall I took my last ride of the year around November 15th, not expecting to ride again until at least mid-March. But we had incredible weather toward the end of February and I was out at least seven or eight times on one of my two bikes between that time and early March. Then Winter returned, and with a vengeance. More snow than we had seen in the last couple of years and cold, nasty weather almost every day. Now here it is April and it was still 26 degrees this morning. I'll be away for the total eclipse, but I am hoping that when I get back, so will riding weather. At my age I hate to see time go by where I can't or won't ride (I don't ride just for the sake of saying I got the chance to ride, if its no fun due to cold, rain, wind or whatever, then what's the point of riding?).\n\nI turn 81 in less than two months. Right after my birthday in early June I plan on taking what well might be my last long motorcycle trip. Right now I'm not sure if I will head West from northern Illinois to South Dakota/possibly Wyoming, or head East to Dayton, OH to visit the USAF museum that I've wanted to visit for the last several years.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Waiting for Spring","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/waiting-for-spring.253598/","Date":"2024-04-06","Tags":[]}
