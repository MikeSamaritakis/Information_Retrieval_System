{"Content":"Hello. Due to the needs of the technical inspection in my country I had to replace the turn signal with a turn signal with European markings. I replaced it and I did not like the frequency of blinking and also I noticed that it flows twice. On the seller's page it says about a relay with a regulator I ordered it I put it on and it's better, I can adjust the frequency as I need. But the double flows are still there. The polarity is correct, the relay is correct, the only thing I suspect is the resistors. Maybe someone has encountered such a thing and can give some advice. I would like to note that before replacing the relay and turn signals, there was no such thing. Maybe it's not the motorcycle system itself, but the turn signals themselves?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"LED double flow issue","Author":"Jocker","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/led-double-flow-issue.253258/","Date":"2024-02-19","Tags":["flowing","led light","led turn signal","turn signal"]}
