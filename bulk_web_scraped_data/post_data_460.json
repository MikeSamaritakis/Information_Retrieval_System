{"Content":"My grandkids tell me that of course young people have abandoned Facebook and X, and never, ever participate in forums of any kind. Tik Tok and Instagram are all that they need to gain the totally distored view of reality that young people seem to accept as valid. It seems pretty obvious that those of us that still read and comment on forums like this one are the \"old fogies\". A few years back someone did a poll and it clearly was weighted toward the over-50 crowd. Now I would guess it is mostly those over 60, if not even older. I'm actually 80, but getting close to 81 so I put myself in the 81-90 category.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Just how old are the members of Motorcycle Forum?","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/just-how-old-are-the-members-of-motorcycle-forum.253423/","Date":"2024-03-14","Tags":[]}
