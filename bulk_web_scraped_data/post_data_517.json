{"Content":"Hi all, I got a 2008 Hyosung Aquila GV250 about a month ago as my first bike and I've found the battery completely drained after a recent ride. I live in the city center so my rides are relatively short, stop-go, and I had never gone above 60kmph, but I've never had any issues with the battery draining until now. This past weekend I went on the motorway for the first time and then straight into a very windy and hilly route that ranged between 60-80kmph. I had my high beams on for the second half, but definitely had the lights switched off while stopped at my destination. On the way back, we pulled over and I found that I couldn't start the bike again (ignition switch did nothing, not even an attempt to roll over) and when I checked, the battery level checker I have installed was flashing red, despite having the charged the bike to full that morning. I have since charged it to full again and resumed my inner city driving with no issues.\n\nThe battery was replaced a little over a year ago, so I'm wondering if it may be the stator or R/R. Is it possible that the constant high beam was too much for the charging system to supply? Or that the more intensive roads heated up the plastic wire jackets causing a loose connection? I've picked up a multimeter and am planning on following electrosport's charging fault flowchart to investigate this weekend, but interested in other's thoughts.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Hyosung Aquila GV250 battery completely drained while riding","Author":"Rachel C","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/hyosung-aquila-gv250-battery-completely-drained-while-riding.253365/","Date":"2024-03-05","Tags":["battery care","hyosung aquila"]}
