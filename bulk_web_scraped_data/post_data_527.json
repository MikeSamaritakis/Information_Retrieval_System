{"Content":"Hi! I want to freshen up my bike before this years season, and one of the things i'm looking to improve is some of the paint in the bike. I will attach a photo of one of the problem areas. I am very inexperienced with any painting job, especially on vehicles, and i would love some pointers.\nThe bike is a 2019 Kawasaki Z125 (BR125K). The black coating by the front brake rotor is peeling off quite bad.\nHow can it prevent it from worsening and how should i go about fixing it? Type of paint, sanding etc.\nAppreciate any kind of help and pointers!\nThanks!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nPaint Jobs & Paint Tech","Title":"Help approaching painting motorcycle","Author":"Luutii","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/help-approaching-painting-motorcycle.253356/","Date":"2024-03-04","Tags":[]}
