{"Content":"I could come up with probably a bike for every company. Since it's not my money no risk. I imagine other people who are into bikes could do the same.\n\nSo here is an idea for a bike .\nA big like a thousand cc push rod single from Harley. With belt drive and self adjusting valves. Without the air cooled sportster they don't offer a budget bike. They sell twins over 2000 cc now . Unlike the Buell blast they could counter balance it. Harley has excellent vibration control with rubber mounting their engines. Harley has a history with singles.\nA single is easier to hit emissions standards with. KTM and Ducati have near 700 cc singles that produce mid 70hp. While being pretty much vibe free. So a lower revving bigger single is possible. Maybe 60-65 hp. Make it 500 lbs and you have a solid bike.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Bikes I would build if I was in charge","Author":"MarkG","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/bikes-i-would-build-if-i-was-in-charge.253337/","Date":"2024-03-02","Tags":[]}
