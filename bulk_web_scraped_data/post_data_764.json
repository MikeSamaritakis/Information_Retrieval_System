{"Content":"Hello!\n\nThis is my first post and i am wondering if anyone knows the reason why the oil pan gasket of my bike is shaped like the image I’ve attached.\n\nIt’s a Suzuki GSX400F and I changed the oil pan the other day and had to replace the gasket. I cut out the gasket with rubber gasket material around the rim of the oil pan so that it would cover the entire rim and the rim only. When removing the oil pan I noticed that the shape not only covers the rim but it has more material with cutouts for the drain and pump. It doesn’t seal anywhere around the inside lip. When looking after I’ve installed my gasket I noticed that the OEM gasket is shaped like this.\n\nAnyone know if this is necessary for the bike to function correctly or that it will work with only the rim covered?\n\nThe pan seals fine and there is no oil leakage.\n\nThank you!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nSuzuki","Title":"Suzuki GSX400F Oil Pan Gasket","Author":"Ramin237","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/suzuki-gsx400f-oil-pan-gasket.253105/","Date":"2024-01-24","Tags":["gasket","gsx400f","oil pan","suzuki"]}
