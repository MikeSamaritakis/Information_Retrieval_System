{"Content":"I'll admit I was intrigued when the first electric bikes came out, but between the cost and the very limited range I never seriously considered it. I wonder now if these bikes are selling even halfway well, or if the novelty has worn off and they will disappear shortly from the industry. I was at a Harley dealership recently to buy a pair of fingerless gloves and was looking at the bikes on the showroom floor. I asked about the electric Harley and was told that they did not have one, would not likely get one in, and that the salesmanager thought was overall a big failure by HD. More recently I was at a small dealership that offereed, among others, the Zero electric motorcycle. Again they seemed very expensive, and BIG! Not for me, but maybe some want to get one of these.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Electric bikes a fad or here to stay?","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/electric-bikes-a-fad-or-here-to-stay.253806/","Date":"2024-05-01","Tags":[]}
