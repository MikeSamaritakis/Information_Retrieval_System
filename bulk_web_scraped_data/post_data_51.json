{"Content":"Hey guys new to the forum and road bikes in general. I picked up a hyosung gt250 not running. All I knew was it needed a new tank as it was rusted and a front wheel but have figured out the carburettor is leaking a fair bit of fuel on the inside and out of the exhaust. I only tried to start the bike once as I realised the carb was leaking. My question is would that make the bike just rev not idle when it dose start. Two things that made me turn the bike off straight away would they be related.\n\nthanks for any help in advance","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"2006 Hyosung gt250","Author":"Jett02","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/2006-hyosung-gt250.253811/","Date":"2024-05-02","Tags":["hyosung. carburettor"]}
