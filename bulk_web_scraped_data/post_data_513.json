{"Content":"So, back in december I bought this chopper project for $4k, and it seemed like it was mostly decent, though it wasn't titled, and hasn't been since the bike was built. I received a bunch of receipts for miscellaneous parts such as bearings, headlight, brake pads, wheels and tires, but nothing for major components like the forks, engine, or transmission. I do have the certification for the frame, and the serial numbers match, but my concern is with titling the bike without any paper trail on the engine and trans. Am I SOL on that and have to purchase new engine just to be able to title it? I am in Iowa. Thanks.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nüèç Motorcycle Forums üèç\nChoppers and Showbikes Forum","Title":"Custom Chopper Titling Inquiry","Author":"ChopSketchy","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/custom-chopper-titling-inquiry.253376/","Date":"2024-03-06","Tags":["chopper","custom","engine","legal","title"]}
