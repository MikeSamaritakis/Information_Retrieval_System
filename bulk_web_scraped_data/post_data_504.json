{"Content":"This is my dirt bike in the late 1970s. It was sold in 1981 and I haven’t ridden a dirtbike since. I recently digitized a lot of 35 mm film. Can someone help me identify the specific model of this bike? I know it was a 250 but I don’t know the model and I’m not sure if it’s possible to identify the year. It was great fun to ride . Thank you.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\n🏍 Motorcycle Forums 🏍\nVintage Forum","Title":"Need help identifying 1970s Suzuki","Author":"TwoTrackTrailRider","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/need-help-identifying-1970s-suzuki.253383/","Date":"2024-03-08","Tags":[]}
