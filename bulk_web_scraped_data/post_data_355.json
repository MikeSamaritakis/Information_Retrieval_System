{"Content":"Hello! I’m new to this forum and still generally new to bikes so I’m scratching my head pretty hard with this issue I’ve been having lately. I got an ECU flash from Norton a while ago because I bought an R3 with a full Akro exhaust but for some reason, the bike doesn’t start with the flash. Bought a stock ECU to see if it’ll start again and it does. As I wait to hear back from Norton on getting the tune checked, what are some other possible issues that could be causing this? I want to make sure I’m not overlooking the simple things. Thanks!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\n🏍 General Motorcycle Discussion 🏍","Title":"Reasons to why bike won’t start after ECU flash?","Author":"Jisung","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/reasons-to-why-bike-won%E2%80%99t-start-after-ecu-flash.253522/","Date":"2024-03-27","Tags":[]}
