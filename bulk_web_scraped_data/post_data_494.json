{"Content":"My 85 NH 650 had the stock jets, and because of a stumble just off of idle, I boought the complete kit from carbjet kits. I also cleaned the carbs.\n\nFast forward...\n\nIt runs great, but the fuel mileage is about 20-25 mpg. From what I've read it should be higher. This makes me wonder if I did the right thing. Perhaps the bike didn't need the kit, but the carbs just needed to be cleaned and the pilot jets adjusted. Plugs look normal, so I know it's not running too rich.\n\nAnyone have the same experience as me? maybe reinstall the smaller main jet, or put the needle jet back to the stock position?\n\nBTW, I haven't synced the carbs yet, (but I will tomorrow).","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nHonda","Title":"shouldn't my fuel mileage be better?","Author":"genel","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/shouldnt-my-fuel-mileage-be-better.253391/","Date":"2024-03-08","Tags":[]}
