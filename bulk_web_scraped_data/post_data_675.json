{"Content":"I have posted previously about my 2000 Kawasaki ZX6R that sat for 12ish years. I've been redoing it getting it to run and have redone carbs, fuel filter, pump, etc. Most of the basic stuff has been done including syncing. I have searched for a vacuum leak and came to the conclusion with another mechanics there is none. I've been told to check the idle ports one more time to ensure not clogged one more time. When draining the carbs, I noticed that the fuel level in carb 1 and 3 was signifigantly less than 2 and 4. Would the overfilling of the carbs be a likely cause of the run away idle.\n\nPlease any advice helps!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"2000 ZX6R Run Away Idle HELP!","Author":"DVantage","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/2000-zx6r-run-away-idle-help.253201/","Date":"2024-02-09","Tags":["carbureator","idle issues","kawasaki zx6r","rev issues"]}
