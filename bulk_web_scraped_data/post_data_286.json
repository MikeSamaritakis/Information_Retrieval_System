{"Content":"I have been doing repairs on my 1985 GPz 750. I had trouble getting it to spark and it idled rough. I recently replaced my resistor caps and my spark plugs. I swapped out my starter solenoid and ignitor box. After some work I had it running again only to find out when I open my throttle up the engine starves and dies. It seems to idle alright, if anything slightly higher than normal, but it doesn't seem to match up with my tachometer registering almost no rpm when it sounds about where it would normally idle at 800/1000. I can give it a little bit of throttle and slowly work the throttle up but the sound of the engine does not match where it would normally register on the tach. I'm new to some of these bike repairs so I am at a loss for what to do and look for.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"1985 GPz 750 Engine Starving","Author":"zspetracek","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/1985-gpz-750-engine-starving.253588/","Date":"2024-04-05","Tags":[]}
