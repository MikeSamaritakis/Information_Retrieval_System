{"Content":"Hello, I’m hoping I might be able to get some help with questions I have regarding my v star im trying to fix up. It is seemingly having symptoms of running both lean and rich. I have cleaned my carbs, cleaned my air filter, checked all air/ fuel hoses for blockage, replaced fuel filter and spark plugs. To be noted I haven’t had my carbs synched yet. The bike runs okay, the power is there through all the gears at lower rpm’s but my acceleration cuts out and somewhat surges once I hit the top end of the gears. It is also backfiring during deceleration and sometimes having trouble coming down to the base idle. Choke on helps to start bike better but does not run well or better once warm. I’m wondering if I just need the carbs synched or if there’s something else troubling the engine. Any ideas or suggestions are greatly appreciated.\n\nThanks","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\n🏍 General Motorcycle Discussion 🏍","Title":"Questions about 05’ v star 1100","Author":"Marshdawg","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/questions-about-05%E2%80%99-v-star-1100.253825/","Date":"2024-05-03","Tags":["v-star 1100"]}
