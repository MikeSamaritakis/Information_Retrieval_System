{"Content":"What‚Äôs up guys. my good friend passed and left us with this bike. I want to finish his build. I am picking up where he left off and it looks like it needs a jackshaft. Problem is i have no clue what model fits, I can‚Äôt find one that looks like this with the thin bushings/coupling. I have attached photos. Any response would GREATLY HELP. Things i do know - it has an SS113 serial number AC04548. That‚Äôs about it lol. I need to identify both jackstand and the clutch so i can find info on removal/replacement of clutch as well.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nüèç Motorcycle Forums üèç\nChoppers and Showbikes Forum","Title":"Ultra cycles HELP","Author":"Storagesniper","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/ultra-cycles-help.253609/#post-2765778","Date":"2024-04-07","Tags":[]}
