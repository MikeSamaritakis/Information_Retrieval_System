{"Content":"Hi all, been a bit since I've been on here, but I am thinking about attending Sturgis this year, never been. I've read a bunch about the challenges strategies for logging and all that... so I get it, my main concern is that I don't have any friends that ride, so my concern is getting up there and not having anyone to hang with... I'd consider myself an introvert but with some extravert vibes too, so anyway... any thoughts on this concern welcome if anyone has worked through the same thing and has advice on how to do this better than worse thanks!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Sturgis for riders with no rider friends :/","Author":"gunslinger","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/sturgis-for-riders-with-no-rider-friends.253211/","Date":"2024-02-11","Tags":["sturgis"]}
