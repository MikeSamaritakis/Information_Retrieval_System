{"Content":"Hello, Iâ€™ve had my bike on standby for about a year. It had an oil pan leak and faulty petcock valve. Just had a chance to fix it. But now the carb started leaking gas on carb 1 & 2, probably from just sitting there and gas gunk. Decided to rebuild the carbs. I bought a rebuild kit off ebay, and found a piece that I cant seem to find where to put. Iâ€™m no mechanic. Try to fix things here and there mostly off videos or shop manuals. Does anyone how what it is?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"82â€™ Honda CB650 Carb Rebuild","Author":"Jalejandro.velasco","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/82%E2%80%99-honda-cb650-carb-rebuild.253124/","Date":"2024-01-25","Tags":[]}
