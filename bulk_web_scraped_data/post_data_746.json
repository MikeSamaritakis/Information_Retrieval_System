{"Content":"Recently purchased a 2008 VT750 Shadow Aero Trike that basically bogs down (cutting out) when attempting speeds exceeding 50+mph. It is literally throttling down and stalling until the speed drops below this mark. I then have to have to downshift and work the throttle in order to keep it from shutting down.\nHad it serviced where the service technician found the TPS (throttle position sensor) shorted open as well as two vacuum leaks on two open ports. The carburetor was rebuilt, the TPS set to spec, spark plugs replaced, checked valve clearance, rode with timing light on - did not loose spark, checked flywheel to crank position and swapped computer out and was rechecked for malfunction. After this service it is now cutting out at 60-65mph. Any thoughts and suggestions?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"2008 VT750C Will not go pass 50+ MPH?","Author":"GLC","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/2008-vt750c-will-not-go-pass-50-mph.253116/","Date":"2024-01-25","Tags":[]}
