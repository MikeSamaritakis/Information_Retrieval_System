{"Content":"Hello, I recently purchased a Yamaha LT2 off fb. It isn’t in terrible condition but it isn’t starting up. I installed a new ignition coil and confirmed that it has good spark. I took off the carb and inspected it. The previous owner had it running not long before I got it so I don’t think one of the jets is clogged. The oil injection system is also deleted. Any help/suggestions on what to do to get the bike running is greatly appreciated.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\n🏍 Motorcycle Forums 🏍\nVintage Forum","Title":"1972 Yamaha LT2 not starting","Author":"john.stock98","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/1972-yamaha-lt2-not-starting.253491/","Date":"2024-03-22","Tags":[]}
