{"Content":"Hello riders and mechanics.\nTo start off, I’ll make it honest and simple. I love motorcycles and have had a few in my life time. But I’m not by any means an expert. I understand body mechanics for cars. Anyways, yada yada bla bla right? So above is a pic of what I would need to get info on. Firstly being a rider and not a mechanic, this is a CDI box? It doesn’t have any labels/model brand etc. I’m told that I need a new module, from my electrician (Spanish guy who doesn’t speak a word of English, and get around via his wife who translates) . He does general electrical work and doesn’t really specialize in bikes, though he’s good for it. He told me that “I had to get one of these” If you notice, my module or cdi box, whatever it is, has been scorched! I had flames under my butt, which I had to pull over and put them out. (Flames for paint work=👍 actual flames=👎). This is for a 113 ci s&s motor. It’s not made on an assembly line, so there’s no way I can truly ever go shop at a Harley store. My question is 1)what is it? CDI? Do they catch fire often? it’s a six pin (actual screw driver looking heads and not flat). 2) where would a good place be to get these ? I see they apparently go for 900$ and as cheap as 12$, major difference in price clearly. Thank you for your help and happy riding\n\nVin","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\n🏍 Motorcycle Forums 🏍\nChoppers and Showbikes Forum","Title":"CDI box?","Author":"Broken chords","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/cdi-box.253828/","Date":"2024-05-03","Tags":[]}
