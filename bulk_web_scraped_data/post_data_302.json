{"Content":"Okay so I have a 98 virago 535. My issue is that the front cylinder doesnâ€™t fire unless I give it 50% throttle or more. I have replaced plugs coils. Have had compression tested itâ€™s good. It had a single carb conversion before I bought it. On the richer side with the jets.\n\nAnother issue I have is that it wonâ€™t stay running unless Iâ€™m on the throttle. But I feel like itâ€™s getting enough fuel bc of how rich I have the carb.\n\nthanks","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"98 Virago 535","Author":"Confused-biker04","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/98-virago-535.253574/","Date":"2024-04-03","Tags":[]}
