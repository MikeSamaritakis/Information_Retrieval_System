Piston and cylinder within nominal specs so will add new rings and replace my repaired shifter shaft. Clean up and re seal. With the clean up I would like to address the cover paint/ Coating.

Any tips on restoring the factory finish look?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\n🏍 Motorcycle Forums 🏍\nVintage Forum","Title":"74 TC125L engine, transmission cover and hub paint","Author":"Prospector74","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/74-tc125l-engine-transmission-cover-and-hub-paint.252968/","Date":"2024-01-01","Tags":[]}
