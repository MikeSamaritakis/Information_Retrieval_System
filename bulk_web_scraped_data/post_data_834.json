{"Content":"Hi All, I'm doing what I call a functional resto on my CR, my plan is to ride it rather than a show piece. I'm wondering if anyone has advice on rebuilding rear shock. From what I can gather thru research the shock is a 1986 but it has a dial on the bottom unlike the other stock I've seen. Any thoughts on this shock and where would I find a rebuild kit. Photos attached.
