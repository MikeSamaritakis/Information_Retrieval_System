{"Content":"My 1996 Honda Shadow V-twin 1100\nhas a valve cover gasket leak.\nI have not cleaned the engine in nearly a year and there's probably one cup of oil spread out over the engine and baked on over the last dozen rides and 2000 miles.\nI want to clean it off even if it will come back again later.\nI don't want it to build up to the point that it becomes a fire hazard-- it does smoke a bit and stink when it's idling at a red light or stop sign.\n\n\nSo: How do you clean a really dirty greasy grimy motorcycle engine & undercarriage?\n\nI've never used any spray on products.\nDo they work?\nAre spray on engine degreaser is safe for all the rubber and plastic parts on the bike?\n\nI've always washed cars' exteriors with soap and water with a bucket,\nbut I don't think that's gonna cut it this time. There's too much stuff in the way to really rub away the greasy spots with my hands and fingers and a rag. There's a lot of oil and grease built up in places that my fingers can't reach.\n\nI thought about taking it to a commercial car wash facility and using their high-pressure spray wand, but I wonder if that might be a problem with my compromised valve cover gasket.\nI wouldn't want to spray high pressure soapy water my engine!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nHow To","Title":"How To Wash & De-Grease Engine","Author":"gunsmoker","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/how-to-wash-de-grease-engine.253744/","Date":"2024-04-23","Tags":[]}
