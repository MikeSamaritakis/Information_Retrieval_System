{"Content":"Hello! I just got a motorcycle and while the ride is great, the gas tank has a few visual flaws. In particular, it has a few rusty chips, scratches and oxidation. I did a lot of research and hoped someone could confirm my game plan or help me with suggestions:\n1. Working on the chips. I would start sanding the rust out of them with 400 sand paper, apply a primer (if there are any recommended, please let me know). After letting it try for 2 hours I paint the holes in new color (I got a matching color online) and after letting that dry for another 2 hours I apply the clear coat.\n2. Working on scratches. Iâ€™ll start with thoroughly cleaning the tank and use cleaning alcohol as last step. Then I use 1500 sandpaper (wet) and work on the areas that are scratched. Then I switch up to 2000 wet sandpaper and afterwards clean everything with cleaning alcohol again. I get a polish machine and use maquires ultimate compound to polish the entire tank. That should also fix the oxidation.\n3. Waxing. After 2 weeks of waiting I wax the entire tank.\nHappy about any recommendations, since Iâ€˜ve never done it before.
