{"Content":"I have an 83 cb650 nighthawk that was given to me by my great grandad. The bike was sitting for close to 30 years but I completely restored it. The engine runs and idles fine but the issue Iâ€™m having is it wonâ€™t go when I put it into gear, it will rev up in gear but wonâ€™t move. Iâ€™ve replaced the clutch disc and springs, rebuilt the slave cylinder with a kit from online, new master cylinders, & new brake and clutch hoses but still nothing. I even made sure the neutral position sensor was good which it was. The shaft spins when I rotate the wheel in neutral as well. At this point Iâ€™m generally lost but donâ€™t have the money to take to a shop, I do have car knowledge because thatâ€™s what I generally work on. Any suggestions?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Wonâ€™t go","Author":"D1983","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/won%E2%80%99t-go.253274/","Date":"2024-02-22","Tags":[]}
