{"Content":"Sag adjustment on a dirt bike is a very important part of set up, but what about street bikes? “Giving up” about 1/3 of one’s travel when you have 12-13” to work with is one thing and I was always curious about it, but does this apply when you only have 5” to work with?\nI’ve adjusted (decreased from stock) my new street bike preload front and rear just by butt-feel/ride comfort, but never thought to check the actual numbers. FWIW I’m about 175# geared up. Just curious because sag never seems to be a topic of general conversation, but maybe is with the road racer types🤷🏻‍♂️","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\n🏍 General Motorcycle Discussion 🏍","Title":"Rear end sag adjustment?","Author":"Noclutch","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/rear-end-sag-adjustment.253849/","Date":"2024-05-06","Tags":[]}
