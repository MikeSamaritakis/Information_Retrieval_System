{"Content":"Hey folks! Iâ€™m a country boy in central WI and a new member here. I donâ€™t really like motorcycles, but will sell anything I can get my hands on including motorcycle related stuff. I do like dirt bikes though. My neighbor/friend bought a new Kawasaki 230R last year. My grandpa has an old blue Honda street bike. I donâ€™t know all the details, so hereâ€™s what I do know: him and or his now deceased dad bought it brand new back in the day, they put around 60 miles on it that first summer, itâ€™s been outside tarped ever since, I have no idea why he tarped a brand new bike! Heâ€™s only kinda interested in getting it going again next summer.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"New member in WI","Author":"Country Boy","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/new-member-in-wi.253226/","Date":"2024-02-13","Tags":[]}
