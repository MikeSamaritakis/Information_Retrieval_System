{"Content":"Hey fellow riders,\n\nI just bought a 2011 ZX6R equipped with an SC Project slip-on (cat deleted). The other day I just let It idle for a few minutes (with a few little revs) on the street before shutting it down and putting it back in the garage. Now... After some time the whole lower floor of the house smelled like the exhaust. After checking for leaks I concluded the smell did not come from anywhere else than the end of the exhaust.\n\nAny ideas on why this might be happening and how I can fix it, so the house won't smell like exhaust fumes everytime I come back from a ride? Would It help putting the\ncatalytic converter back on, or would there be a bigger problem?\n\nThanks in advance for your help!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Exhaust smell in house","Author":"Pierrezx6r","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/exhaust-smell-in-house.253668/","Date":"2024-04-14","Tags":["exhaust","garage","smell"]}
