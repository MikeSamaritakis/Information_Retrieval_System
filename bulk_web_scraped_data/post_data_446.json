{"Content":"Hello fellow riders, newbie here still working on technique, I was out practicing in the parking lot today working on slow speed maneuvers and for the life of me, this bike kept jerking at the slightest movement, I'm talking between 5 to 10 mph. I captured the recommended shift points on my phone for this Honda CB500f which shows the following in the owner's manual:\n\nFrom 1st to 2nd (12 mph)\nFrom 2nd to 3rd (19 mph)\nFrom 3rd to 4th (25 mph)\nFrom 4th to 5th (31 mph)\nFrom 5th to 6th (37 mph)\n\nI've watched various videos and read a number of articles that included: Throttle freeplay, (which I measured), throttle control (jerky motion), using rear brakes to illuminate jerking, etc.\nI searched this form for related information but I haven't come across anything. Again, I was just trying to perform slow speed maneuvers at 8 mph and the bike kept jerking\n\n\nNote: when shifting to higher shift points, no jerking motion, only during low speed maneuvers on flat surfaces.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Events\nSoutheastern USA","Title":"Slow speed maneuvers - bike keeps jerking","Author":"spenc083","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/slow-speed-maneuvers-bike-keeps-jerking.253441/#post-2763586","Date":"2024-03-18","Tags":[]}
