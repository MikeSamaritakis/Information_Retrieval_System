{"Content":"Going to check out and likely buy a 2014 FJR1300ES with 54k miles tomorrow. I am pretty good with general motorcycle maintenance but never owned a Yamaha or checked out an FJR1300. Anything particular I should look out for or pay extra attention to?\n\nI have considered C14s, ST1300s, a couple BMWs, and the Versys 1000, but looking at specs, purchase price, and price of ownership, the 2014/15 FJR300ES seems to be the sweet spot with the last of the 5 speeds before they switched to 6 speeds and LEDs in 2016, but seem to have all the options I want besides the LED lighting, which I imagine I can do something with.\n\nThis is basically a tryout to see if I want to replace my 2014 Valkyrie with an FJR300ES. As much as I love my Valkyrie, it is a tad low on power and I really want pegs under my bum for the riding type I do.\n\nAny other suggestions are appreciated for a high speed cruising do anything on road bike, or adventure bikes if they are sufficiently capable on road as well and affordable.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nüèç Motorcycle Forums üèç\nTouring Forum","Title":"Buying a 2014 FJR1300 What to look out for?","Author":"Joel_The_Mole","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/buying-a-2014-fjr1300-what-to-look-out-for.252912/#post-2756536","Date":"2023-12-21","Tags":[]}
