{"Content":"Hello,\nI'm Jason from wisconsin and 49 years old. I drive Hondas and currently drive a 1999 Valkyrie. I also have a 1971 CB450. Owned a 2004 VTX1300, but was rear-ended, so that one is totaled. I'm mostly going to be looking for parts, because I'm currently looking for Vintage/classic bikes to rebuild.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"Forum Newbie","Author":"jayzotte","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/forum-newbie.253412/","Date":"2024-03-13","Tags":[]}
