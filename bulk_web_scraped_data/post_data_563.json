{"Content":"Hey there,\nDon't get mad from the title for a start\n\nI am currently living in Greece and I ride a Honda Steed 400, which I bought for 2k, Harleys here go for around 6-7k for a nice sportster.\n\nI am having a debate with myself considering whether I should upgrade my Honda Steed and spend around 1 to 1.5k maximum, to change the engine and make it look better as well, or just be a bit patient and get a Harley which is a dream of mine.\n\nHarley pros and cons:\nIt's a Harley\nI will be able to cruise much more comfortably since my Steed is going at 120/130 klm per hour tops, which is frustrating when I ride on open roads\nI will have to spend more money to maintain it, but my question here is how much more...\nI will be a bit stressed every time I take it off to work and stuff since in Greece they tend to steal a lot (usually though they don't mess with Harleys, but overall you never leave your motorcycle out of sight here)\nRiding into town for work etc won't be the most comfortable thing since the streets and traffic here are pretty bad\n\nHonda Steed\nIt feels better to ride it into town and leave it unattended sometimes since I am not afraid that someone is going to mess with it, also it feels a lot better to drive through traffic without worrying that something will happen to it, In general, I don't worry about anything since it's not such expensive in a way...\nIt is uncomfortable to drive into big highways since I feel it has no power... I do a 100klm trip and I feel like it's about to explode even if I stop like 2 times to give it a rest.\nI suppose that fixing it is also cheaper\n\nMy current state is that I live in Greece as I mentioned and let's say I make 1k per month... Considering that I buy the Harley, will I be able to maintain it?\nAlso from what I hear, Harleys tend to \"break\" more often than a honda steed, I don't know whether that's true or not, but I don't have the comfort of staying without my bike for more than a day (let's say I have to leave it to the mechanic or whatever)\nAlso, I would like to note that I don't care about the weather, I ride even if it is pouring rain like hell... (Although if I get the Harley I think that I will stop doing that, which will be a hustle for me..\nFinally, I am talking about a used Sportster from the 1990s, yes that costs from 6k to sometimes even 12-13.\n\nI understand that reading this can be very frustrating for you Harley Riders, but I want to consider everything since I will have to spend all of my savings doing a move like that... I am 23 years old so no family to take care of etc, it feels like the best time to make a move like this","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Harley or a Custom Honda Steed","Author":"GeorgeX0006","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/harley-or-a-custom-honda-steed.253322/","Date":"2024-02-29","Tags":[]}
