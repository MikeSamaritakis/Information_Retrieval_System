{"Content":"At the risk of starting a long drawn out thread similar to asking about one's preferred oil, I thought I would ask everyone what brand of motorcycle tires they prefer. I am getting new tires and had selected some Dunlops, but the salesman talked me into some more expensive Michelins. The stock tyres on my Triumph were Metzlers and they were fine. I usually use Bridgestone or Shinko tires on my dirtbikes. When buying car tires, I have a favorite local tire shop and buy the mid-priced tires that the shop has in stock or can get quickly. I generally don't have a brand loyalty or preference. Just curious what everyone else thinks or does with respect to tires. Of course, comparisons would have to be made using equivalent grades of tires.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"What's your favorite brand of motorcycle tire (tyre) ?","Author":"Sparkman","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/whats-your-favorite-brand-of-motorcycle-tire-tyre.253690/","Date":"2024-04-17","Tags":[]}
