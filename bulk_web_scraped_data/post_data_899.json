{"Content":"Recently discovered crank has play in it and bike is making a whirring noise on top of the sound of the engine so presumably my crank bearings are on the way out, rather strapped for cash due to the time of year and so can't afford to replace the bike and rather limited in terms of available options as obviously bike would have no resale value in current condition and I don't have the tools or experience for splitting cases and what not, leaving me to think my best bet is just to get another engine and try my hand at installing it myself, however the sh engine seems cheaper and more available, and I've noticed there are a few common parts between the 2 bikes, just wondered if anyone had tried to attempt anything similar?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nHonda","Title":"Can you put an engine from an sh125 in a pes125?","Author":"Rondingo9321","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/can-you-put-an-engine-from-an-sh125-in-a-pes125.252925/","Date":"2023-12-23","Tags":[]}
