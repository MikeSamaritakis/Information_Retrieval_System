{"Content":"Yesterday I was out for a nice 50 mile, one hour ride. I chose to take my CanAm Spyder because it was so windy with gusts at about 45 mph. With 3 wheels and about 1,000 pounds of weight, the Spyder does very well despite the strong cross winds, but I had to keep my helmet visor fully closed because open it felt like it might get snapped off in the high winds. Despite the bright sun and the high temps, not too many bikes were on the road, and those that were seemed to all be going quite slowly. I think I passed more two wheelers yesterday than I have on any recent ride. I assume that with 2 wheels the wind was having even more of an effect than it did for me on 3 wheels.\n\nAnother area where the Spyder seems less affected by wind than on regular motorcycles is when exposed to the wind blast of large trucks heading in the opposite direction on two lane roads. I always try to move as far to the right as is reasonable to try to offset the push of the wind blast, but with the Spyder do not feel a need to do anything. The passing trucks just do not bother me at all. In fairness I have to say that my new Royal Enfield Hunter 350 does not seem overly affected by passing trucks even though it is not a powerful bike, lightweight at 400 pounds and of course, has 2 wheels. I think that this is due to not having a windscreen. This is the first bike that I have owned in decades without a windscreen , and I think that this is why I am not feeling much of the wind blast from the trucks.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Three wheels in the wind","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/three-wheels-in-the-wind.253357/","Date":"2024-03-04","Tags":[]}
