{"Content":"Over the last fortnight I have noticed that where as before I would just have to see the brake light light up from holding the brake lever on my scooter and press the push to start to turn the engine on I am now having to push the brake levers quite firm to start the engine or the engine will not turn over or stalls which seems a little odd. I have charged the battery which seems fine and wondered on the off chance if anyone had any experience and if it could be something simple like the brake switches getting gunked up or corrosion on the brake switch contacts or something simple like this as I thought the ignition on push to start worked off the brake light wiring and not how hard you pushed the brake lever to start the motor?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§\nTool Talk","Title":"push to start brake lever becoming harder","Author":"Micatropolis","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/push-to-start-brake-lever-becoming-harder.253375/","Date":"2024-03-06","Tags":[]}
