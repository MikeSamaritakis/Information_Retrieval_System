{"Content":"My son bought a 2017 Aprillia motorcycle 39 days ago. Engine froze up, thankfully he’s okay, but the cost of the repair is more than the value of the motorcycle. Torque warranty is saying they won’t pay for it because of that. He’s contacted the dealer and they’ve not called him back, yet. Is there any recourse? He bought the motorcycle “as is” but bought a warrant hoping if anything went wrong he’d be covered. 🤦🏻‍♀️","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\n🆕 New Member Introductions 🆕","Title":"What to do?","Author":"Jrudd","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/what-to-do.253346/","Date":"2024-03-03","Tags":[]}
