{"Content":"1986 Xv700 Virago\nDuring oil change snapped oil filter bolt\nTook off crankcase cover and left hand drilled it as much as I could then inserted screw extractor and snapped screw extractor while twisting. Used a dremmel and tried the flathead trick that didn't work. Tried tapping it counterclockwise and dug into the block a little bit. I don't mind retapping it that's not the problem and I can always fill the damage with a gasket sealer. But the bolt is still jammed in the block and nothing else comes to mind. Really don't want to pay a mechanic to figure it out either..","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"HELP SNAPPED OIL FILTER BOLT IN BLOCK","Author":"camachoash21","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/help-snapped-oil-filter-bolt-in-block.253045/#post-2758267","Date":"2024-01-13","Tags":["broken bolt","crank case bolt","oil filter","snapped","xv700"]}
