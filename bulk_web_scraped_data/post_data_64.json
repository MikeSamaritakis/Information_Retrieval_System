{"Content":"This thing is geared ridiculously low. About 75 mph or so at 4,000 rpm. Redline starts around 10. Taking off in 2-3 on this thing is about the same as taking off in first on my 600 GSXR. I'm a curious guy. WHY ? Is it emissions to keep the breadbox cat hot ? Is it to make the bike feel more nimble around town ? It's a technological marvel but kind of silly in some ways. Why would a sport cruiser with the emphasis on sport be geared like that ? And the gearbox is closely spaced. In some gears I'm only dropping around 500 rpm's. It deff tends to make me go slower. That's a good thing. You hammer it you better be ready to shift. It winds out quick. Not really complaining, I'll change sprockets. Some have added two teeth up front AND taken one or two off the back. That's gonna help greatly on take off, and at highway cruising, but in between those two points it'll feel the same.\n\nWith the key on and the bike not started it makes a very quiet beeping noise. You'd never hear it with the bike on. Thought it was pretty cool. I get on the Ninja forumes...Nope. No One Nothing. One guy says it sounds like it might be an apple air-pod. I google the sounds they make, yep, it's an air-pod being powered up. (must be hard wired to the ignition) Text the previous owner, yep. Says he sticks them on everything and forgot about it. I wonder. Guy seems like he has way better things to do than track my bike. but who knows. I said I'd mail it back to him once I got it off.....","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Semi Interesting observations on my 2020 Ninja SX","Author":"Joey Bones","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/semi-interesting-observations-on-my-2020-ninja-sx.253797/","Date":"2024-04-30","Tags":[]}
