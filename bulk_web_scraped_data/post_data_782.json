{"Content":"Hello, new rider here, have about 900km under my belt, passed my basic learners test, with about three weeks of riding in. FYI\n\nHave been trying to ride a variety of roads/freeways and build up some experience in all conditions.\n\nToday went for my longest ride and half way through it, was riding a very hilly area with some lovely turns. I noticed on a lot of corners on some of the roads that I took there were was a build of loose stones in the middle of my lane, both along the flat and around the corners. I was ok on the straight, managed to ride either side of it. However in a couple of turns, was lightly braking into the corner avoided the stones, but on one such corner there were stones in middle and my front wheel was under a light brake, however just started to slide as I came across it. Fortunately I wasn't going that fast throughout corner, I released the front brake, and the bike sat up and I managed to get through corner just, however it really shook me up. It was way too close to losing complete control and crashing.\n\nWhat can you do, when you are wide turning into a corner and notice stones in the middle of your intended line whilst braking (front only) across it. I saw the stones only in the turn late as they were shaded by over hanging large trees.\n\nLove any thoughts or suggestions on this.\nThanks Andy","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nMotorcycle Training, Safety, and Riding Techniques","Title":"New rider doing some twisties and nearly lost bike in corner with loose stones built up .
