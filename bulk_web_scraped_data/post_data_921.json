{"Content":"I have a 125 ttr 2008 which I canâ€™t get started. It was running fine 3 years ago but took it out of the garage to get it running again a few weeks ago and canâ€™t get it started. So far I have done the following: 1) replaced the gas with new gas 2) replaced the carburetor 3) changed the spark plug It still wonâ€™t start. It turns over just fine but wonâ€™t start. Any recs on what to do next?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"2008 ttr 125 wonâ€™t start","Author":"Jm5799","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/2008-ttr-125-won%E2%80%99t-start.252898/","Date":"2023-12-17","Tags":[]}
