{"Content":"Hello everyone,\n\nI'm Stan from France, and I always wanted to ride on the US West Coast on a motorcycle. Now that I managed to find a job in the US (based in NY), I'm starting to organize a roadtrip for this summer (end of June to beginning of July 2024).\nAt first, I was considering riding alone, but after some thinking I believe it would be the opportunity to meet other riders along the way ! I'm still young (25) and don't have a lot of riding experience, so it would be an occasion to learn as well.\nFor the approximate itinerary, I'd like to see SF, LA, some of the parks, and then ride more in the lands towards Road 66.\nTotal trip = between 2 and 3 weeks long.\n\nPlease do not hesitate to give me advice for this trip, and share with me some websites or groups (FB, Whatsapp...) where I could find other riders to share a part of the trip !\n\nThanks guys, cheers !","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"Looking to meet people and go on a roadtrip on the US West Coast this summer","Author":"RandomArtistFR","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/looking-to-meet-people-and-go-on-a-roadtrip-on-the-us-west-coast-this-summer.253629/","Date":"2024-04-09","Tags":["#roadtrip","west coast"]}
