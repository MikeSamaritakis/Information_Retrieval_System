{"Content":"Hi all\nI am new to motorcycle maintenance, and recently did a some work on my Honda cbf250 front fork.\nI stripped the fork down and disassembled to fix leaking fork oil seals.\n\nOne of the forks went down no problem, however the second damper retension bolt got stripped managed to get the bolt off by using a size up imperial Alan, which actually seems to get good purchase.\n\nI stripped the fork and replaced the seals. This is where I get uncertain.\n\nim going on a long trip (2 days ride, 11 hours) tommorow, and due to the time constraint, decided not to replace the bolt. I couldnâ€™t torque it due to lack of imperial Alan sockets, but I tightened it quite tight (aiming for about the same tension I applied to the other fork tube using a torque wrench) and applied blue lock tight. It feels pretty bomb, I think I could get it out currently, but it wouldnâ€™t be super easy tightness wise.\n\nbasically Iâ€™m wondering:\n\nA: would people think itâ€™s likely for this bolt to loosen? My mate said stripped bolts tension unreliably, which makes me worried about the bolt loosening. I feel like itâ€™s tight enough, if anything Iâ€™d be concerned about over tightening, but Iâ€™m new so unsure.\nB: if it did loosen, how dangerous would that be?\nI donâ€™t care if it would cause damage, damage can be fixed. But I donâ€™t want to lose my front wheel at 100 km/h.\n\nI'm currently planning on seeing if I can find a replacement bolt anywhere around town and if I can Iâ€™ll probably pull it and replace for peace of mind, but if that fails Iâ€™d like to guage risk?\nThanks,\nJames.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"How dangerous is fork damper retention screw failure?","Author":"Jimhbean","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/how-dangerous-is-fork-damper-retention-screw-failure.253148/","Date":"2024-01-30","Tags":[]}
