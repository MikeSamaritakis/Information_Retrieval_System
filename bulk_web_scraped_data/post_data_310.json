{"Content":"So recently ive been trying to sell my ybr 125, it was stored for a few months or so. Naturely the battery was dead, I replaced it. Now theres another problem, the starter motor only works when the bike is running (which is obviously pointless). So we checked the battery voltage, 12.6v. Should be fine, any ideas to what it could be?! I got a seller coming over sunday so thats why I need it fixed, thanks!!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Starter motor only works when the bike is running (Yamaha YBR 125)","Author":"Untertaber","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/starter-motor-only-works-when-the-bike-is-running-yamaha-ybr-125.253562/","Date":"2024-04-02","Tags":["issue","starter motor","yamaha","ybr125"]}
