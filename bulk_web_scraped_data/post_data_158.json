{"Content":"We are now 1 month away from this annual event that is now 12 years old ... and growing bigger every year so far.\n\nThis is primarily about a group of enthusiasts getting together and stylin' through the city on bikes.\n\nIt is also a fund-raiser for men's health issues. Though not as much fun to talk about as breasts, testicular cancer and suicides kill more people every year. The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride has donated $45 million towards programs working to reduce those negative impacts.\n\nI am pleased to see that my closest 'big city' now has one being organized. My wife and I are seriously considering trailering our classics 1.5 hours each way to participate.\n\nHmmmm: It just occurred to me that I might try to set up \"a test ride\" for one of the new classic-styled bikes on that day.\n\nFor more information: The Distinguished Gentleman's Ride","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Events\nInternational","Title":"Distinguished Gentleman's Ride, May 19, 2024","Author":"Bitterroot Bugler","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/distinguished-gentlemans-ride-may-19-2024.253707/#post-2766840","Date":"2024-04-19","Tags":[]}
