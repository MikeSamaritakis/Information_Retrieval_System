{"Content":"Happy to join the Honda Forum. I been Honda riding for the past 48 years. I love the 1970s stock Hondas all original and refuse to change them. My current bike is only a 1975 CB125S . I had to go to a smaller bike because my feet could no longer touch the ground when I ride my 1978 Honda CB750 or my 1976 Hinda CB550. Looking forward to chatting with others.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"Just joined","Author":"Donnyboy","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/just-joined.252988/","Date":"2024-01-04","Tags":[]}
