I'm a young guy just getting into bikes and I'm looking to clean this up, as a project.\nI've attached some images and if you have any recommendations to get the job done, that would be appreciated.\nAlso lemme know if some parts are too far gone.\nSo far, I'm getting some 0000 steelwool to deal with the minor rusting then going to buff out any existing scratches + the ones i make with some light metal polish.\n\nCheers, Jet","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nBuilding, Restoration & Modification","Title":"Suzuki 2008 S83 VS1400 restoring","Author":"JetVS","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/suzuki-2008-s83-vs1400-restoring.253261/","Date":"2024-02-20","Tags":[]}
