{"Content":"I have always had a hard time lifting my bike so figured it out. Did not want to build anything, nail or weld anything and wanted it to be compact to put away.\n\nPurchased a VEVOR 1100 lb jack two of them. Model 110202. One for the front and one for the rear. The bike weight is about 500 pounds so over kill on the lift, but adds to stability and security.\n\nThe main thing is it has two saddles per lift since there are so many obstructions below.\n\nNow have front and back fully off the ground and very stable w/o ropes yet. I just mark everything for next time. Testing out to see if hold firm for a few days.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nüèç Motorcycle Forums üèç\nCruiser Forum","Title":"Lifting a 2003 Honda Shadow 600 55K","Author":"WC","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/lifting-a-2003-honda-shadow-600-55k.252943/","Date":"2023-12-26","Tags":[]}
