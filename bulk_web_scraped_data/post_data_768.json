{"Content":"Hey there,\n\nI bought my first bike brand new in May of 2022. Got two year tags on it and that’s going to expire this year. This might seem like a dumb question, but is renewing the tags for it the same as a vehicle? Every year an inspection has to be done and then present that at the DMV to get newer tags for the license plate? I’ve heard different things like “You have five years till you have to do an inspection for the bike to get new tags since you bought it brand new” etc. Just curious and still learning a lot about riding, maintenance, cosmetics on the bike, and great gear to buy when riding.\n\nThank you!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nFirst Bike / New Rider","Title":"New/first bike.
