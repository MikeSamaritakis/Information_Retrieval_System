{"Content":"Hi guys, Iâ€™ve recently purchased a Honda CBF 125 (2010). It had about 20,000 miles it was in good condition and worked perfectly fine.\n\nUnfortunately I dropped the bike exiting a junction at around 5-10 MPH. This resulted in the front brake lever snapping in half and the front right indicator smashing, including the bulb. Apart from the broken indicator the bike still worked fine.\n\nLater that day Iâ€™d started the bike up again and noticed that the neutral light wasnâ€™t working. Upon further inspection Iâ€™d realised that now none of the indicators would turn on, the horn wasnâ€™t working, the brake light worked but didnâ€™t get brighter when the brakes were activated and the engine light which would come on as you turn the key to on no longer worked.\n\nThe bike is completely dead electronically until I start it. It still starts and runs fine. The brake lights still turn on and the headlight works. This is my first manual motorbike and my knowledge on repairs especially electronically is very limited so if anyone has any idea what the problem could be please let me know.\n\nSide note: before Iâ€™d dropped the bike as Iâ€™d turn the key to the on position the bike would make a whirring sound (I think this has something to do with the bike charging system). As I turn the key to the on position I no longer hear that sound.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Bike starts and runs but has multiple electrical problems","Author":"Jaxumm","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/bike-starts-and-runs-but-has-multiple-electrical-problems.253635/","Date":"2024-04-09","Tags":["motorbike","repair","repair beginner help"]}
