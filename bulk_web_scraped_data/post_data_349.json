{"Content":"I've been researching the best overall summer street Jacket and pant combination for impact and abrasion protection. years ago I ordered a Ultra 2 over pant from Motoport and found their construction and quality the best seen or rode in. Here I am years later and need a spring to fall riding gear and seem their aren't any other choices for Textile protection in the current market. Most garments are the best a poly or 500 Cordura stretch w/ not the best protection or ventilation. Their website hasn't been changed in years; their material and padding is thinner, but still 100% Kevlar. I visited their store in Southern CA, not impressed w/ collection, but was measured up, but when done in past found garment still needed alteration for proper fit and padding to be stiff. The other contender is the Rukka stretch air is probably 2nd best to most, not near as tout as Motoport, but still a stretch 500 Cordura w/ 700 in vulnerable places for abrasion. Motoport is a more a utilitarian design and Rukka and others have some style built in.\n\nWhat You Say:\nTnx...","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Related News\nMotorcycle Gear News","Title":"Motoport jackets and pants recent purchase anyone ?","Author":"ninjaboy650","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/motoport-jackets-and-pants-recent-purchase-anyone.253527/","Date":"2024-03-28","Tags":[]}
