{"Content":"Been riding for over 40 years, but all small displacement mopeds, bikes, motorcycles (49cc - 125cc). Currently have a 1978 Puch Maxi, 2020 Ruckus and a few Metropolitans. Just purchased a 2020 Honda Super Cub c125 ABS (Nebula Red and white). I joined as I have an engine noise in the Cub that I was hoping the community could help me to diagnose. That thread was put up about an hour ago (Noonish, PST on 5/4/24).\n\nThanks in advance for any help you all can offer!\n\nBest,\n\nJohn","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"Hello; another new member, checking in!","Author":"Jebinc","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/hello-another-new-member-checking-in.253838/","Date":"2024-05-04","Tags":[]}
