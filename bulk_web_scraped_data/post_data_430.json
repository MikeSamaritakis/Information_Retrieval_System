{"Content":"I'm trying to decide what to put on my personalized plate on my NINJA 400. I have something in mind, but apparently several other Missourians had the same idea so the most obvious letter combinations are taken. I'd like everyone to guess (except for those of you who got it by text--don't spoil it for everyone else!!!) so I can get an idea of how evident the meaning is. If you agree with someone's guess, give it a LIKE:\n\n\n\nI'm also trying to come up with a name (male, neutral, or non-human such as \"Lucky\", family-friendly) for my new bike (2023 NINJA 400).\n\n\nAny suggestions?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"CNUGUES?","Author":"BAZININJA","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/cnugues.253451/","Date":"2024-03-19","Tags":[]}
