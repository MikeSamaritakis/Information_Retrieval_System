{"Content":"Hi,\nI'm Harry. I haven't been here in awhile I own an 81 CB900C, an 83 CB1000C, and an 03 VTX 1300. I've owned my 81 CB900C since 1986 or 38 years. I love this bike, but it's been misbehaving for about 3 motorcycle seasons now. I am bound and determined to get it roadworth again.\nThanks.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"I'm back . . .","Author":"HarryBeckmann","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/im-back.253602/","Date":"2024-04-06","Tags":[]}
