{"Content":"I'm looking to buy my first motorcycle (used as I am a broke student) I live in North Dakota and if you know anything about my state is that it is VERY windy all the time. I'm looking to buy in the 250-600cc range. I've talked to a friend of mine who has rode for awhile and had a zx6 and zx11. He states that 55mph on his zx6 felt like 120 on his zx11. His concern is that with our winds a lighter 250cc bike will get thrown around way to easy and might be dangerous. (I am also 135lbs) I'm concerned that I shouldn't start off with 600cc simply because its to much, but I also understand where he is coming from. I've been looking at a 16' Hyosung GT250r and a 07' Yamaha FZ6. I've also looked at CBR500 and 250 and Ninjas. So what should I invest in?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nFirst Bike / New Rider\nSport Bike As First Bike","Title":"New Bike","Author":"violetren","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/new-bike.253268/","Date":"2024-02-21","Tags":[]}
