{"Content":"Hello. I have a Motobi DL 125 motorcycle. I know it is a chinese one but who cares, does the job. I have a problem with it. Whenever I turn it on, even after some minutes, at around 5-6k rpm it stutters very badly. After some time, it runs perfectly. It's worth mentioning that I think the stuttering sound is coming from the box the airfilter is in. Also, I think this happens more when the weather is cold, but still I have symptoms like: poor acceleration (especially uphill), and low mileage. Could it be the airfilter? (who seems pretty clean) or the fuel system?\nAlso, it seems that this happens at a fixed number of rpms, thats what making me believe it could be something electrical/ECU related. What do you think? Any help is apreciated.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Sputtering at 5-6k rpm and higher.","Author":"Bogdandev","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/sputtering-at-5-6k-rpm-and-higher.253359/","Date":"2024-03-04","Tags":[]}
