{"Content":"Hello, I just joined the forum. I recently bought a 1981 Suzuki GS250T with 2458 miles on it. Although it has low miles, time has taken a toll, especially to the rubber and aluminum parts. Someone in the past even welded patches on the exhaust pipes where condensation probably ate holes in them, but they didn't smooth out the welds. All the lights and signals work though, so we settled on a reasonable price. I trailered it home because, although the seller put a new front tire on it two weeks before I bought it, the rear tire has cracks all around the sidewall. Finding a 3.50 x 17 tire was a challenge, but Duro still makes one, which I've ordered. The seller bought the bike 20 years ago to teach his wife, but that never happened, so it mostly sat, and he only rode it occasionally. The seller said he flushed out the fuel tank and cleaned the carbs last summer, and the gas in the tank is from then. He never changed the spark plugs, so they're 20+ years old. It will start, but it is very cold blooded and even warm it will not idle without the choke. It will rev if the throttle is slowly rolled on but will bog with faster throttle applications. Obviously, I will drain the fuel and replace it with fresh and change the plugs. Beyond that, I feel the carbs are the problem. They are Mikuni BS30 SS. I have not been able to locate a rebuild kit for them yet. Any thoughts? Thanks in advance.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nSuzuki","Title":"Just bought a 1981 Suzuki GS250T that needs some help","Author":"goofyfoot53","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/just-bought-a-1981-suzuki-gs250t-that-needs-some-help.253259/","Date":"2024-02-19","Tags":[]}
