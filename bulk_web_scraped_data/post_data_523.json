{"Content":"I sometimes practice to handle acceleration, on empty roads. I may roll at 22 mph (3k rpm, 2nd gear) press the clutch, slowly rev to 7-8 k rpm and drop the clutch. Not so much happens, the front wheel rises 1-2 inch (and I learn to handle that).\n\nBut if I rev up with a small, fast flick of the wrist and immediately drop the clutch, like the wheelie guys but w/ less power, my impression is the engine delivers much more power and one must be really careful.\n\nWhere does the power of a wheelie come from, if you quickly flick the wrist and drop the clutch?\n\nOne factor must be kinetic energy in the engine. The flywheel suddenly connects to the drive train. But are there more factors? Does a sudden quick flick of the throttle also \"load the injectors with gas\" and give this really strong power surge? I know too little about the throttle and injection system to tell.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Wheelie power","Author":"swede","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/wheelie-power.253368/","Date":"2024-03-05","Tags":[]}
