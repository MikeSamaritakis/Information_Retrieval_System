{"Content":"Hi there, My name is John & my nick name is Madrugada, I am 73 years old, I am Scottish by birth & have lived in the South of Spain for the last 20 years. I have ridden motorcycles since 1966, mainly in the cold, rain & snow in the North, now I'm playing out my motorbiking days in the warm Climate of the Costa Del Sol. Having said that, I was on the point of hanging up my boots & helmet as I have lost a lot of confidence & stability after some health issues. I'm OK now, great in fact & I am keen to stay on the road, so I've bought a sidecar & stuck it on the side of my bike which is a BMW F650 GS. My intention is to carry on touring Europe little by little, obviously with the sidecar on it is totally different to riding a bike, a bit weird, in fact, but much more stable & slower...........great fun though. I belong to a motorcycle club here in Spain & they are all old geezers like me & we are all of the same mind, touring, staying on hotels & enjoying the various European cultures. I look forward to a good relationship with other members, with or without sidecars. Cheers, John.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"Introduction.","Author":"Madrugada","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/introduction.253061/","Date":"2024-01-17","Tags":[]}
