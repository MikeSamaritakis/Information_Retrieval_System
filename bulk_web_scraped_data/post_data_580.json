{"Content":"Hello, I've just gotten an older 1996 Suzuki GS500e that refuses to start. This is the first bike I've worked so I have very little experience with them. Anytime i try and start it it either doesn't start at all and just clicks or will turn over and idle for a few seconds then die again, spraying starter fluid in the airbox makes it turn over more often but it will still die after a few seconds even with the choke fully on. so far I've tested the spark which is working fine and I've fully rebuilt the carbs which were weirdly clean for sitting for god knows how long. I've also had to change the gas tank out for a leak but i doubt that would change anything, there is gas getting all the way down to the carbs and filling them.\n\nIf any more information is needed id be glad to provide it - Steven","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"96 Suzuki gs500e not startin","Author":"Steven954","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/96-suzuki-gs500e-not-startin.253301/","Date":"2024-02-26","Tags":["help","help with bike","repair","repair beginner help"]}
