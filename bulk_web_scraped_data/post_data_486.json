{"Content":"This year has been weird. I have been out riding several times this season, with the first ride of the year in early February. But here it is March 10th, and its back to winter cold. 26 degrees this morning, and only expected to reach about 40 today and for the next couple of days. But being an optimist, I am not throwing the covers over the bikes just yet. I do have them on Battery Tenders but I sure hope that I can ride again soon. Riding is about the only activity in my life where I am not acutely aware of my age. I'm 80, but as soon as I put my bike into gear and twist the throttle I feel like 40 years has slipped off me. I may be sore and stiff after an hour on the bike, but at least I have had that hour.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\n🏍 General Motorcycle Discussion 🏍","Title":"Back to winter","Author":"vito","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/back-to-winter.253396/","Date":"2024-03-10","Tags":[]}
