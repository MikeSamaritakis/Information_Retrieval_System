{"Content":"Hello,\n\nI am getting close to finished on my 1978 XL125 project. When I bought this bike it was in pieces mixed with the parts from a 1982 CX500. Among other parts, the bike was missing the seat and exhaust. I got it running for the first time today! Anyhow, I need a muffler and can't find a stock one that isn't rusted out. Can anyone provide advice on a suitable muffler for this little bike? Here is a pic of the bike. I have the header pipe. Just need the rest.\n\nThanks.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nüèç Motorcycle Forums üèç\nVintage Forum","Title":"1978 XL 125 Muffler (silencer) recommendation","Author":"Sparkman","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/1978-xl-125-muffler-silencer-recommendation.253164/#post-2759581","Date":"2024-02-02","Tags":[]}
