{"Content":"I need to remove the carbs. I've done it before, and it's really difficult. The part that makes it most difficult is the filter box. It doesn't slide back far enough to allow the boots to clear the carbs. I hope there is an easier way. BTW, I have the factory service manual, and the Clymer manual, both make it seem like a half-hour job, and don't cover the things I'm mentioning. Several things I've done to make it easier, (but still not easy) is to remove the two screws holding the air box in the back, and removing the voltage regulator from the left side of the air box. This allows the air box to slide a little further back, but not quite enough to give enough room to slide the carbs out easily. I've been removing the boots, but it's quite difficult and I'm afraid I will tear one. Could removing the inner fender make it easier? Thanks for any suggestions.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nHonda","Title":"Carb removal for my '85 650sc Nighthawk","Author":"genel","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/carb-removal-for-my-85-650sc-nighthawk.253683/","Date":"2024-04-16","Tags":[]}
