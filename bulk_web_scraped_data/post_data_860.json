{"Content":"Hey, I'm making a bike out of a chainsaw. Are these specs enough for it to produce enough power? Looking to ride it on a long stretch of\nlevel bike paths so I can get around without having to use a car (I'm doing a driving test in a week) I know you might think I'm crazy, retarded or both,\nbut I find the idea of making your own bike pretty sick.\n\nHere are the specs\n\nengine:\ntwo-stroke\n\nengine displacement:\n49.3 cm3\n\nmaximum torque:\n2.8 Nm\n\nnominal power output:\n1.9 kW\n\nrotational speed:\n10300 rpm\n\nchain thickness:\n1.5 mm\n\nchain speed @ max power output:\n20.8 m/s\n\n\n\n\nweight:\n\n6 kg\n\n\nDon't tell me \"it's illegal\" Yeah I know, it's gonna be my personal project and either way I'm going to make it. I'm gonna cover\nthe chainsaw with these black pouches you see on bulky BMW motorbikes so when I see the cops I can just turn the saw off.\n\nAlso here's a pic of what the chainsaw looks like (I got an older model but it was the same price)\n\n\n\n\nGod bless y'all","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nBuilding, Restoration & Modification","Title":"Making a bike out of a chainsaw","Author":"effefe","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/making-a-bike-out-of-a-chainsaw.252959/#post-2757087","Date":"2023-12-29","Tags":[]}
