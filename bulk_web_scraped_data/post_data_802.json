{"Content":"Hey guys. I’m brand new. No! I’m not even brand new…. I’ve never ridden a motorcycle before and I’m almost 50.\n\nI’ve been on bicycles for a long time. I’ll do long 60 mile road cycling adventures and enjoy black diamond mountain bike trails, even if I’m not the most aggressive.\nI LOVE biking.\nFor years now, I’ve wanted to step that love of bikes up to motorcycles but…. I’ve always decided against it because of the lack of safety.\nNow, I’m ready to take that step. I want to get a bike. I’m thinking along the lines of an adventure bike like a KTM or BMW or something but, in all honesty, would likely end up using it more for my long freeway commute and some open country asphalt rides on days off. So… cruiser, adventure bike, eventually touring bike…. Definitely not sport bike. (Not interested in racing.)\n\nim TALL. 6’5”\n\nok so, I am ready to start getting into it but….. as I’ve said, I’ve only SAT on a motorcycle once or twice in my life, never ridden one. In order to get started, I need to go over the most basic practices you could imagine.\nSo my question is…. How can I do this? I can’t test ride a bike at a dealer (or private seller) without having sole basic practice under my belt. I can’t pick up a cheap used beater if I don’t know how to ride it home lol.\nSo where can I go to start this process? Are there used dealers that would deal with a person with my total lack of experience?\nAre there classes that provide bikes to learn on?\n\nthanks in advance. Don’t judge me! 😂","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\n🆕 New Member Introductions 🆕","Title":"Brand new, need advice.","Author":"Maigesheng","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/brand-new-need-advice.253010/","Date":"2024-01-08","Tags":[]}
