{"Content":"FZ6R overheating and low coolant light\nI have a 2009 Yamaha FZ6R and Iâ€™ve recently encountered a problem with overheating. The low coolant light came on while i was on my way home from University and the temps went over normal operating conditions, so I changed the coolant and bled out all the air but the issue persisted. I checked the water pump and it was working when I turned on the bike. I was told maybe it was a head gasket issue, but a car mechanic friend told me the coolant would be either mixing into my oil or smoke would be coming form the engine and I checked oil and it was fine, also no smoke was ever coming from the bike. I ended up changing the thermostat and it didn't fix the problem. I checked fans and they kick in around 200 degrees F. The old coolant looked good. The radiator has no cracks and none of the hoses are leaking coolant. At this point I'm lost on what to do.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"FZ6R overheating issue","Author":"Ascension","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/fz6r-overheating-issue.253208/","Date":"2024-02-10","Tags":[]}
