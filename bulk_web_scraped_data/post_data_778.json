{"Content":"Hey y'all. I started riding just a few months ago, but I've put over 2000k on my bike this summer. The bike in question is a 2015 cbr 300, and it is SLOW. I hope to sell it soon, but over the winter i've got nothing better to do than read the forums. I prefer sport bikes, but I've got a few cruisers I'm in love with (like the '86 Yamaha Fazer). I've bee into sportbikes my whole life, as my dad has a '99 R1, my mom has a '99 zx6, and we have a mulitiude of other bikes in our garage. Hopefully I can get some advice on where to find the bikes I am looking for here, but otherwise I'm just here to lurk.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"I've got a slow bike.","Author":"IloveSlowBikes","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/ive-got-a-slow-bike.253059/","Date":"2024-01-15","Tags":["introduction"]}
