{"Content":"I take trips every year now that i bought a touring bike. I take right around 1000 mile trip (one way) a few times a year sometimes. My biggest fear is breaking down on the road. If it is a problem that can't be repaired on the road, what do you guys do? Do you have it towed to a dealer and then go back to pick it up? I would love to be able to rent a truck/trailer, put the bike on the trailer and tie it down and go home ,but many truck rental places like u-haul don't have hitches, right? I would imagine it's to protect their investments. Are there any places that do rent out trucks with this type of setup?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"What to do when breaking down 100's or 1000's of miles from home","Author":"cc rider","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/what-to-do-when-breaking-down-100s-or-1000s-of-miles-from-home.253786/","Date":"2024-04-29","Tags":[]}
