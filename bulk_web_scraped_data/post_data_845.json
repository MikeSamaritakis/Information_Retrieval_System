{"Content":"On a ride this past weekend I noticed a problem while wearing four layers of jackets in the mid-30s temperatures and wearing (of course) a full face helmet.\n\nI came to some intersections where the road I was on had a right turn lane, and that lane was angled were you would be guided to stop (or yield, in some intersections) at a very sharp angle to to Right.\n\nTHE PROBLEM: trying to look your left to see if it was clear to make a right turn, you'd have to turn your head at an extreme angle to the left.\n\nI could not turn my head as far as I wanted to do to the restrictive clothing and the helmet scraping my jacket.\n\n\nONE TIME, I absolutely could not see clearly with direct vision over my left shoulder. But in my peripheral vision, and this is at night, I saw what I thought were a set of headlights from a cage least 100 yards away (and the traffic has been going pretty slow on the cross road.)\n\nSo I pulled out --but it turns out that either that car was a lot closer & a lot faster than I thought,\nor there was some other car that I didn't see at all,\nand.\n\nIt was hitting its brakes right behind me in an instant. And beeping its horn.\n\nIN THE FUTURE,\nI resolved to pull up to such intersections in the right turn lane\n--at first hugging the right curb\n\nthen when I get to the balk line or decision point to pull out into the road (main road) I will angle my bike LEFT so I'm closer to perpendicular , giving me good visibility in both directions.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nMotorcycle Training, Safety, and Riding Techniques","Title":"Winter clothes + FF helmet = headlock","Author":"gunsmoker","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/winter-clothes-ff-helmet-headlock.252967/","Date":"2024-01-01","Tags":[]}
