{"Content":"Hi I am looking for some advice on an issue which is quite strange.\n\nI am currently working on a Lexmoto Assault 125 2020 plate. Its EFI. I was having some issues with the indicators not wanting to play ball unless the bike was leaned over or the steering was turned. After removing the fairings and headlight and checking all the cables, terminals and connections, they started to work as normal. However now the EML has come on the dash and the bike is a non start, it is ridden regulary nearly every day and dry stored in a garage overnight . In addition to this the battery is new as of a few weeks back when the old one that was in it when i bought it in November of last year had finally ran dry.\n\nThe strange part of this is with the EML on the bike appears to be priming the fuel pump, once when it turns on as it should but also now when the lights are switched from Dim to High beam and vice versa. To which I assume is causing an issue with the ECU and the EML and obviously the non start now.\n\nIs there any advice that can be given on things to try to remedy this as I would rather not have to put it in a garage and then more than likely an autoelectrician as the money is not there right now.\n\nMany thanks","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Fuel Pump/Electrical Issue","Author":"ChineseBikeEnthusiast","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/fuel-pump-electrical-issue.253489/","Date":"2024-03-22","Tags":["125cc","assault","eml","fuel pump","lexmoto"]}
