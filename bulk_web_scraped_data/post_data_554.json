{"Content":"Hi all, new to CBRs and the forums. I recently bought a 1988 Honda Hurricane 600 and and am trying to diagnose an issue I am having with the front brakes. I originally rode the bike back 250 miles with no issues, only to struggle here in town with my brakes seeming to heat lock. It only takes a few blocks for them to start self applying and getting very hot.\n\nAs I did not struggle with this issue on the way home, that makes me believe that it is not the brake lever, and that it is properly adjusted. I did find a seized piston in the front right caliper, replaced it, and am still having this issue. After R&R the caliper, I took it out to test and the same issue occurred. The fluid is obviously over pressurized, as when I cracked the bleeder screw, it shot fluid out. The caliper is very hard to compress, and I am unable to do it by hand. To me (very green to bikes so would love some help), that leaves two possible causes:\n\nA) The compensating port in my master cylinder is bad and not allowing fluid to return to the reservoir to reduce pressure while fluid expands from getting hot.\nB) My brake line is splintering internally and acting as a check valve, allowing fluid to run towards the caliper but not back\n\nBefore I order parts, is there a way I could test to see if it was either of those, and if not, which one would you all think most likely to be the culprit here?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nHonda","Title":"Honda Hurricane Brakes Locking Up","Author":"Scrongle","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/honda-hurricane-brakes-locking-up.253333/","Date":"2024-03-01","Tags":[]}
