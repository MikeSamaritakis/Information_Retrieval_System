{"Content":"Hello everyone, I have a 2000 kawasaki ninja zx6r that sat for 13 years, and I am finding a hanging rev at 5000-6000 rpm when I set my idle screw to proper position according to manual. When i unscrew the idle screw, it revs no problem, just won't go to idle. Is this a throttle issue and a sign I need new throttle cables or something with the carbs.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"ZX6R Throttle Issue","Author":"DVantage","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/zx6r-throttle-issue.253011/","Date":"2024-01-08","Tags":["idle issues","kawasaki zx6r","throttle cable"]}
