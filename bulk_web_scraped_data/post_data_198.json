{"Content":"Hi, Iâ€™ve just recently bought a daystar VL 2012, after riding it 22km to bring it home it was absolutely fine. The next day I took it out for a cruise, then at a set of traffic lights, the clutch went and stalled the bike, after starting it up the clutch wouldnâ€™t engage at all.\n\nIâ€™ve taken the clutch apart and there isnâ€™t any signs of damage and there doesnâ€™t seem to be any reason for the clutch not to function. Iâ€™m no mechanic by any means but I know my way around a bike if anyone has any idea please reply to this forum asap. Thankyou!\n\nFor reference hereâ€™s a photo with the case off.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Daystar VL 125 2012 Clutch","Author":"bailey125cc","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/daystar-vl-125-2012-clutch.253662/","Date":"2024-04-13","Tags":["#clutch","#daystar","#help","#issues"]}
