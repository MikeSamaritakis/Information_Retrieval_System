{"Content":"Hello. Sorry all. I don't use our computer much due to some bad eyesight, so I had trouble initially with the beginning procedures. Hello to everyone. I am originally from Niagara Falls, NY. Spent a lot of time in Canada visiting relatives and playing music in different venues. Moved to Orlando, FL area in 1979. I am 73yrs. old and retired for 10yrs. Married for 53yrs, two kids and some grandchildren. I was a musician for many years, worked in multiple companies, some technical but most not. I know a little about engines and electrical systems, but I'm no expert. I inherited my father's 1961 Harley Davidson Topper Scooter and would like to ride it. I rode on it with him when I was a kid, but I have never driven it or any type of motorcycle. Now, at 73, I want to learn to ride it. An old dog can learn new tricks. I am delighted to find a site where others with more expertise and experience may be able to advise me","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"JohnD","Author":"JohnD","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/johnd.253752/","Date":"2024-04-24","Tags":[]}
