{"Content":"Hi all,\n\nI'm looking at some used BMW 310R models. Originally I was looking at electric, but used Zero motorcycles are about 10k, and there just seem to be too many variables with battery stuff at this point in the technology. Gas just seems easier, and they get pretty good mileage.\n\nI haven't ridden, and I also don't want a super powerful bike (at least at this point). The BMW 310 seems like a good choice because it's reliable and well-built, gets good mileage, the price is right (I see a 2018 and a 2020 both with about 4k miles for roughly $4k), and it seems like a good beginner bike.\n\nSo I'd be riding for about 10 minutes on the freeway to get to work. I would also use it for getting around town. Do you think this would be a good bike for me?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nFirst Bike / New Rider","Title":"New Rider Looking to Commute to Work 5mi on Freeway and City Stuff BMW 310R?","Author":"jades","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/new-rider-looking-to-commute-to-work-5mi-on-freeway-and-city-stuff-bmw-310r.253335/","Date":"2024-03-01","Tags":["bmw g 310r"]}
