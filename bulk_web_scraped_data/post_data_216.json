{"Content":"I’m not really sure what forum this belongs in, so I’m just posting it here, mods feel free to move if you think there’s a more appropriate forum. This is a 212cc predator engine on an American made Schwinn bicycle frame, with Suzuki K10 motorcycle forks, a long moped seat, and currently moped rims but I’m upgrading the front wheel to a Suzuki rim with 110mm drum. It’s also got a charging flywheel and stator, complete lighting and horn system. It’s got a variable speed belt transmission, and it’s geared to go 60 but I’m still working on tuning the carb. Replacing the rear brake shoes tonight and might be able to get a test ride in if the weather holds.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\n🏍 Motorcycle Forums 🏍\nVintage Forum","Title":"Home built motorcycle","Author":"The Shake","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/home-built-motorcycle.253639/","Date":"2024-04-10","Tags":[]}
