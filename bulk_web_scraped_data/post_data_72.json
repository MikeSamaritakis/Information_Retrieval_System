{"Content":"Hi All\nJust joined. I'm hoping to get over to the UK this summer, buy a Super Cub and head to Scandinavia. I'm 75 with 60 Years riding experience. My last ride was a month around Puerto Rico in January. Have ridden in all 6 rideable continents and 38 countries. Often one or both of my daughters traveled with me. I have a RE Himalayan, a KLR650 and a Sportster 48. All are heavily customized to accommodate my needs such as back rest, heel and toe shifter, windshield, aftermarket seats and 3 point lighting front and back for all.\nI have two questions for anyone who knows and would like to enlighten me.\n#1 will I have any trouble buying this bike and insuring in the UK at my age?\n#2 have read various reports on windshields for the Cub and a number of people have mentioned flex in a negative way because of illdesigned mounting. If you have a windshield and it works great for you I'd like to know please\nFortunately I have family in Kent so I will be storing it with them after the trip and it'll be ready for the next ride. Right now I'm interested in Eastern Europe and Scandinavia. This trip will be to Scandinavia so if you have any relevant info I'd be happy to hear it. All my trips have been on secondary roads. I'm always looking for out of the way roads with little truck traffic so I can cruise without worrying.\nGlad to be hear on the forum and if the bike turns out to be just my cup of tea I'll be getting one here too. Here being Colorado.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"American new guy","Author":"kuri77#","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/american-new-guy.253792/","Date":"2024-04-29","Tags":[]}
