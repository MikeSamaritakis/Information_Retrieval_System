{"Content":"Hey I just got my first project bike, 82 CB900, and am wondering where i start. Besides cleaning the gas tank im not exactly sure what to do. The engine cranks but and would probably run if i had the gas tank attached. I imagine the carbs need to be cleaned, but I'm mainly trying to figure out what needs to be replaced vs works. The bike hasn't been running for about 9 years. I have most the parts that aren't in the picture they're just not on the bike.\nAlso any websites or youtubers you guys use would be appreciated.\nOn top of that I am thinking of streaming working on the bike once I know what to do. Thinking of doing that because I imagine other people probably know more and could help me out in live time that way.\nThank you all for reading\nUpdate: spent a day looking at stuff, waiting on some tools to run tests, but coils came back reading 2.5 ohms but didn't see any spark when i took the cable off the spark plug and held it to a ground. Also all 3 calipers are frozen so that will be another thing to learn how to do.\nSecond Update: Made sure wires were tightened and i did see spark, i was able to get the outside ones off, but i couldn't check the inside spark plugs, didn't have the right size socket so i have to figure out what size it was, read it was a rounded 18mm but when I get ahold of a shop manual I'll know for sure.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Manufacturers\nHonda","Title":"First project 1982 CB900","Author":"JacobRev","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/first-project-1982-cb900.253125/#post-2759035","Date":"2024-01-25","Tags":[]}
