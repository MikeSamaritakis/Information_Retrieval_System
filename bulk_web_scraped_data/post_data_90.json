{"Content":"I bought a 74 cb125s for $5. I had to put a new carb on it and then I took a battery off of one of my Harleys. It fired right up and i played around on it for 2 months before the coil fried. That's when I found out it has a 6v. system. Bought a new coil,condensor and battery. Ran for a week and crapped out again. It's got fire and fuel but won't run unless it's got 12v running through it. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated. Also, what's the difference between a cb125 and a cb125s?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"1974 honda cb125s 6v system?","Author":"Dfj72","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/1974-honda-cb125s-6v-system.253775/","Date":"2024-04-28","Tags":[]}
