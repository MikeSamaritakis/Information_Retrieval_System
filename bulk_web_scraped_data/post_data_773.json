{"Content":"Hi! Call me Meteor! I found these forums recently and it felt right for me to sign up. I've wanted a motorbike since I was young, and the want's never gone away. Hopefully it's a dream I'll achieve sooner rather than later--last year I saw a model I attached to immediately and talked myself out of it because of money issues and such, but I'm looking into things again. So I hope I'll be able to buy one some time in the near future. I've already got a bunch of gear picked out for if this becomes reality. I'd just need to practise getting used to wearing more layers in the heat than I'm usually able to tolerate considering I overheat so easily.\n\nðŸŒ  2023 Harley Davidson Nightster in Redline Red\n\nHere's to wishing on stars!\n\nMeteor","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"Hi","Author":"meteorite_love","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/hi.253068/","Date":"2024-01-18","Tags":[]}
