{"Content":"yamaha gt50 1974. Last time it worked was 20 something years old. Had the magnets and igniton switch broken, replaced them all (now i have a constant and pretty spark), but the iddle was terrible and no throttle. People sugested it was bad timing or something with the carb, checked the timing and it is on the only spot where i have constant spark and where it iddles(its as factory). Carb cleaned it 3 times ,each time thought it was badly clean (it was not), replaced the jets by brand new ones and new seal for the carb bowl. The issue is still there 0 throttle and bad iddle, now i think it might be a vacuum leak(i also replaced the air filter, anything that is obvious i checked) if its not a vacuum leak i'm honestly out of ideas.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Help. bad iddle not throttle","Author":"Muxus","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/help-bad-iddle-not-throttle.253843/","Date":"2024-05-05","Tags":[]}
