{"Content":"I have had this bike for two months and it has ran great, I recently put on a aftermarket exhaust and rejeted the carbs with Dynojets stage 2 jet kit. But now I canâ€™t get the bike to run right going down the road. Above around quarter throttle it starts to stutter and if you push it more of course it bogs. Iâ€™m pretty sure itâ€™s a fuel issue but am not positive. Any insight would be appreciated.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"99â€™ Suzuki Marauder rejet issues","Author":"JaydenJohns","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/99%E2%80%99-suzuki-marauder-rejet-issues.253794/","Date":"2024-04-29","Tags":["#suzuki"]}
