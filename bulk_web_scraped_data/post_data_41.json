{"Content":"so I just recently bought a gsxr 2012 750. Unfortunately, I noticed a wobble in the front tire as I’m ridding today. The bike has only 1500 km so barely ridden on the roads yet. So was a bit alarming\n\nBefore I purchased the bike the previous owner told me it had been sitting in a garage floor same set of tires it came with for 8+years. I’m just wondering if the wobble while ridding is due to defective tires after prolonged sitting. Or should I be more concerned with some mechanical issues with the bike.\n\nWondering if anybody could ease my mind and help me out.
