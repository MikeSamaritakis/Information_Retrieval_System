{"Content":"I purchased what I mistakenly thought was a complete K10 Corsair 66 68 68 front wheel on eBay. Turns out, it’s not complete. No brake plate, no axle. The axle isn’t a big deal, but I’m looking at brake plates and there is a 1967 K11P front brake plate for a reasonable price. I reached out to the seller of the wheel to see if they’re willing to do anything to help make this right because the brake plate is pictured and I messaged before I bought it and they told me everything pictured was included. However, on the off chance they don’t do anything to help, will the K11 brake plate fit the K10 wheel?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\n🏍 Motorcycle Forums 🏍\nVintage Forum","Title":"Suzuki K10/K11 wheel parts compatibility","Author":"The Shake","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/suzuki-k10-k11-wheel-parts-compatibility.253582/","Date":"2024-04-04","Tags":[]}
