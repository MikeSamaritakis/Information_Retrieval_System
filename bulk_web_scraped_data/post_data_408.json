{"Content":"Hi all,\nI have a Nolan N87 helmet which comes with an internal visor but I never end up using it as I find the glare is almost worse when I have it down. I thought a good solution for this would be a polarised visor, but I can't seem to find much information about them - especially one that would work as an internal visor for my specific helmet.\n\nIs there a reason there doesn't seem to be a huge market for them? It seems like most people just opt to wear polarised sunglasses under their helmets, but I have to wear prescription glasses already and don't own prescription sunglasses.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMOTORCYCLE GEAR\nHelmets","Title":"Polarised Sun Visors?","Author":"Rachel C","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/polarised-sun-visors.253472/","Date":"2024-03-20","Tags":[]}
