{"Content":"New to site. Been riding since 1971. Worked on mostly pre 1985 motorcycles. Worked for Harley , Yamaha dealership in the 80s. Since retiring I started collecting 1960s- 70s motorcycles, Currently I am having my low milage Honda CB750K6 restored. It has been in the shop 4 years. Told restorer that I want the bike back to brand new. Almost done. I feel I know a lot about motorcycles but not everything. Like to hear other opinions on motorcycle issues. Looking forward to joining the group.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"rsenginerepairman","Author":"Roger Solt","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/rsenginerepairman.252919/","Date":"2023-12-22","Tags":[]}
