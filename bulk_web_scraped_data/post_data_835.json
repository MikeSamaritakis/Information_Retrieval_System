{"Content":"Occasionally I need to use a cell phone or gps with gloves on which are not made to be capacitive screen friendly. I bought this stainless steel thread from Amazon https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B079H26WBN/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1. This thread can be sewn (even by those with no sewing talent) into the leather end of a finger on a glove. The idea is to make a mass of thread at the end of the finger that is on both the outside and inside surface of the glove finger. It will operate a capacitive screen, as on a gps or phone. I used a short section of 1/2\" PVC pipe to stuff into the glove finger to aid the sewing; it makes it easier to avoid accidentally sewing the finger too short. Probably a bad idea to try with heated gloves.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMOTORCYCLE GEAR\nGloves","Title":"Gloves, cell phones, GPS","Author":"etex","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/gloves-cell-phones-gps.252981/","Date":"2024-01-03","Tags":[]}
