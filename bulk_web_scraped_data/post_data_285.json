{"Content":"Hi everyone,\n\nI'm a tall guy 196 cm or 6'5\" and I weight about 105kg or 230 lbs naked. I'm thinking of buying a BMW F 900 GS next year. I really like the looks and specs of this bike, seems perfect for me, they ever offer a tall rally seat which is great.\nI don't plan to go off road. But, since I'm bigger and heavier than an average rider, would I benefit from the Showa suspension that's included in the Enduro Package or is it only good for off-road?\n\nThanks","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"As a tall rider, should I get better suspension for BMW F 900 GS?","Author":"Martuson","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/as-a-tall-rider-should-i-get-better-suspension-for-bmw-f-900-gs.253587/","Date":"2024-04-05","Tags":[]}
