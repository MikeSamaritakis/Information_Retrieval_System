{"Content":"Here's where it leaks.\n\n\n\nI tried taking the petcock off, but the 8mm bolts spin and spin and don't come out. New tanks are easy to find but are $175. Seems like a lot for what is probably a problem with the 0-ring seal. Relevant pics from site selling new tanks:\n\n1. Looks like the two bolts don't go all the way thru to the inside of the tank. The nuts must be turning in the plastic. Have seen this problem with lawn mowers as well. Bad design.\n\n\n\n2. The petcock with no gasket which surprised me:\n\n\n\n3. Misc related parts:\n\n\n\nBetcha the issue is the O-ring. The two parts on the right must be spacers for the bolts at the petcock.\n\nI'm fixing this bike for the neighbor boy who received it from his uncle before he passed away. It means a lot to this kid. I'd like to help him and will involve him all the way through the repairs as there are many others. But first, we've got to get the tank to stop leaking. It does run, but idles kind of high. Initial list of issues:\n\n1. Tank leaks.\n2. Runs but idles high.\n3. Right side foot peg missing.\n4. Rear brake lever and rod are missing and no where to be found.\n5. Front brake cable locked up solid (kid tried to replace cable).\n6. Clutch is very tight at the lever. I can hardly pull it in.\n\nThe young man has a job and is willing to pay for parts. I might try hacksawing those old bolt heads off before suggesting we buy a new tank.\n\nThoughts?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"1996 Honda XR100 gas tank leaks bad at the shut off valve.
