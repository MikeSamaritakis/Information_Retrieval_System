{"Content":"I broke a part of my clutch lever off the other day and finally got around to installing a new one but I canâ€™t get the screw or the nut holding the old one in place to budge.\n\nThe head for the screw is pretty munted but it still turns. The nut turns fine as well. But Iâ€™ve tried every combination over and over - holding the nut still and turning the screw; holding the screw still and turning the nut; turning both at the same time - but neither the screw nor the nut will tighten or loosen from the position they are in. I guess the nut isnâ€™t threading on the screw properly and is just jammed in the same position.\n\nAny suggestions for getting this screw and nut holding my clutch lever in place loose?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Screw and nut holding clutch lever in place wonâ€™t budge","Author":"Leem","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/screw-and-nut-holding-clutch-lever-in-place-won%E2%80%99t-budge.253037/","Date":"2024-01-13","Tags":[]}
