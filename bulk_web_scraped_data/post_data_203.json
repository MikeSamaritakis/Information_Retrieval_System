{"Content":"Does anyone know the difficulty level of rebuilding the top end of a '73 CB500 engine? I'm willing to buy tools if it's something I can do. Or is it something you recommend not doing? I'm not a hardcore gearhead, I mostly do smaller jobs like oil changes, spark plugs. I’m asking as I want to buy this bike for $900 and am willing to work to get it running well if it’s doable. The owner says cylinder #1 is a little weak. Not sure what other things could be wrong with it. Many thanks!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nBuilding, Restoration & Modification","Title":"1973 CB500 top end rebuild","Author":"PJG 88","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/1973-cb500-top-end-rebuild.253654/","Date":"2024-04-11","Tags":["cb500","honda"]}
