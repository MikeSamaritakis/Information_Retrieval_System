{"Content":"I bought a Kawi z900 a couple of months ago. It is more powerful than what I have ridden before so I gradually try to learn how to cope with the acceleration. Have a good seating position etc.\n\nJust to learn, I sometimes roll about 12.5 mph in first gear with clutch pressed. I then rev a little and drop the clutch. If I rev to 5000 and drop the clutch, the bike makes a small jerk forward, but the front wheel stays on the ground. The bike rises a little on the fork.\n\n12.5 mph corresponds to 2000 rpm, so I \"over rev\" by about 3000. If I increase the revs to 6-7000 I expect to see a baby wheelie, but I haven'y tried that yet.\n\nI will not take up stunting, but I want to feel absolutely relaxed and in control when I drop the clutch at a moderate over rev. Just learning to control the acceleration.\n\nI do the same in second gear at 30 mph and revving to 6000 rpm (about 2000 rpm too much).\n\nWhat do you say about this exercise? Is it a safe way of learning as long as you are in control of the rpms.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Seating practice","Author":"swede","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/seating-practice.253099/","Date":"2024-01-23","Tags":[]}
