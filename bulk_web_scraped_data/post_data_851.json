{"Content":"I currently have a 7 year old schuberth c3 and it’s time to get something new. I want to keep things under $300 and want a full face, not a modular. I’ve narrowed my choices down some and want to hear some opinions from owners who have used them. I’m split between a scorpion t520, scorpion covert fx, and a scorpion 1400. The 1400 is from Chromeburners so I’m hesitant to order it since it’s outside the US.\n\nprice comparison- t520 $170\ncovert fix $212\n1400 $201\n\nThoughts and opinions welcome","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMOTORCYCLE GEAR\nHelmets","Title":"Looking to buy a new helmet, help please","Author":"drewplatt","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/looking-to-buy-a-new-helmet-help-please.252965/","Date":"2023-12-31","Tags":[]}
