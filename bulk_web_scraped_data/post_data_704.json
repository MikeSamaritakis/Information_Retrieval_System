{"Content":"Hey Everyone,\nI painted my fenders on my 2009 Honda Rebel and for some reason the bike won't ever try to start. I can get it to try starting up when I jump the relay wires but still won't start just trys to. When I removed the turns signals, I saw that the grounds were not connected so I went ahead and did that. I removed the grounds hoping that would be the problem but no luck. I have a new battery that reads 12.4V and tried replacing the relay. The only thing I can think of is a short somewhere in the wires but I'm no expert. Any help is much appreciated!\n\nThanks!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\n🏍 General Motorcycle Discussion 🏍","Title":"Bike Wont Start After Fender Removed & Installed","Author":"itskater","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/bike-wont-start-after-fender-removed-installed.253169/","Date":"2024-02-03","Tags":["battery","bike wont start","fender","honda rebel 250"]}
