{"Content":"The bikes a 2017 husqvarna fe250. The steering lock was engaged when the bike mysteriously tipped over busting the steering lock mechanism. I did a bit of research and seems like KTM uses the same system and the basics apply to all bikes. The key still turns the locking cylinder and the handlebars turn freely. I want to repair or replace the steering lock. Thereâ€™s nothing in the owners manual and nothing comprehensive online on how to remove or repair. Iâ€™m inquiring if anyone knows\n1) can it be easily repaired or replaced with basic tools\n2) can I get a replacement that works with my ignition key oem\n3) is it dangerous to ride with potential for steering to lock up\n4) should I bring it to the motorcycle mechanic and stop trying to screw with it\n\nAny insight is appreciated thanks!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Busted Steering Lock need help","Author":"DangerDan0069","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/busted-steering-lock-need-help.253287/","Date":"2024-02-24","Tags":["repair beginner help","steering lock"]}
