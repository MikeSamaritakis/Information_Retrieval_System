{"Content":"Wearing full helmets makes it very difficult to converse with my passenger. So I purchased these intercom units that we should be able to talk to each other without screaming and using hand signals. My problem is that I can't figure out how to use these things. They are, of course, Chinese so the instructions are weird to decipher. I don't know what make/brand they are but, there is a V10 on the side of it. Can anybody tell me how to operate these things? They are supposed to be able to receive phone calls also. thanks, gregjo1948","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Intercom","Author":"gregjo 1948","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/intercom.253339/","Date":"2024-03-02","Tags":[]}
