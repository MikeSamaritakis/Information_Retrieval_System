{"Content":"I tend to fall in love with my bikes and take good care of them. I also tend to keep them for a long time and lot of miles. The last four street bikes were sold at 126,000 miles (1980 Kawasaki KZ550), 16,000 miles ( 2004 Kawasaki Ninja 250), 115,000 miles (2006 Kawasaki Ninja 650), 80,000 miles (2015 Honda CBR500) and my current bike, a 2022 Kawasaki Z650RS which has 19,000 miles). All of those bikes were nowhere near worn out, but because they were considered worthless by most people I had to sell them dirt cheap. I think modern, water cooled, fuel injected bikes to be pretty much like modern cars (which I also keep forever) and are pretty hard to wear out with reasonable use.
