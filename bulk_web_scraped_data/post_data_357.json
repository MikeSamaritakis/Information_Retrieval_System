{"Content":"I am Roger Liston, I am a retired cycle engineer with Honda. I worked in their Torrance location after graduating from college with a degree in electrical engineering. While I went on to sell computer systems in silicon valley for 30 years, my hobby was fixing up cast off motorcycles. I revived a bike every 2 months for 30 years.\nNow that I'm retired ,I specialize in fixing motorcycle electrical systems My website is expert cycle electrics. I am happy to answer questions by email or phone to help you sort out your problems online, if possible.\n\nI also do unusual things like re-equip CB750s with digital gauges for their use on the salt flats, not to mention repairing older bikes that the dealers won't touch anymore. I love helping cyclists so send me a text describing your electrical problems. ðŸ˜Š","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"Introduction","Author":"Roger(Zorch)Liston","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/introduction.253519/","Date":"2024-03-26","Tags":[]}
