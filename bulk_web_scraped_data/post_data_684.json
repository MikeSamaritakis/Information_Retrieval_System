{"Content":"Does anyone have a review of the above tires ? Or a comment from a mate who runs them ?\nI have read some very good reviews but not many first hand user comments.\nMy mate has them(M R 6's) on his SV650 and has mentioned that they are the bomb .This guy has spent years modifying suspension on his little SV650 making it the best handling SV650 it can be but the biggest difference he said is the bike now with the Michelin Road 6's. He rides with the super fast crowd too on out local range , it's mostly tight 3 and 4th gear corners so a modified SV650 is quite competitive . A tad underpowered going up but super fast under brakes coming down the range .\nThe Michelin Road 5 developed cult status among the Super Sport and Cruiser clans using them.\nI have used the 5's and they stuck like glue , so when all reports are saying the 6's are a much better tire than the 5's , I'm looking into it.\nThey're expensive but they just might be worth it.\nONLY MICHELIN ROAD 6 REPLIES PLEASE !\nCheers .","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMOTORCYCLE GEAR\nTires","Title":"Michelin Road 6","Author":"BADNESS","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/michelin-road-6.253190/","Date":"2024-02-07","Tags":[]}
