{"Content":"Long ago bike and scooter rider. Came across this 1987 BMW K 75 C model that needs some work but believe it can be a nice way to return to the road. Appreciate any advice related to finding a 22 mm handlebar to fit this bike. Would anybody know if the one I did find which is 23 1/2 inches will work -since I have found the original should be about 24 3/4 inches. Thanks. Look forward to updating you as the work is completed.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"New member","Author":"nickzoulias61","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/new-member.253275/","Date":"2024-02-22","Tags":[]}
