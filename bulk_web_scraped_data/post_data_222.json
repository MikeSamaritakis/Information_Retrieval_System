{"Content":"Model year make\nZ1000 2008 Kawasaki\n\n1. Initial problem - motorcycle not charging as voltage keep dropping during running on the road.\n\n2. Troubleshooting - replacement of battery\n\n3. Conclusion - voltage is still dropping battery not charging.\n\n4. 2nd troubleshooting - replacement of stator and rectifier. At the same time also replace the clutch plate and friction plate as an extra bonus since I'm opening up the bike.\n\n5. Conclusion - battery is charging as voltage is increasing and stabilize above 12.6volts ~ 13volt. However, after putting it down to gear 1 or gear 2 from neutral there's a knocking sound coming from the left side of the motorcycle.\n\n6. Not sure what I did wrong. As Idk if it's the clutch or generator area was installed wrongly or is it something else.\n\n7. Notes, why I'm confused is because the generator was on the left side, clutch is on the right side. But stator was charging the battery there was no knocking sound when running in neutral. Yet the sound comes in loud when I put it on gear 1 or 2. There's some resistance when I try to engage the gears. Knocking sound is heard when bike was stationary and engage onto gear.\n\nCrash guard was not mounted back not sure if it's because of loose mounting point but I doubt it's that reason.\n\nNeed advice on where to tackle this issue. Or has anyone comes across this.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nMotorcycle Repair, Building, and Restoration\nðŸ”§ Motorcycle Repair ðŸ”§","Title":"Knocking sound on left side of the motorcycle probably coming from the left side.","Author":"Phangyx","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/knocking-sound-on-left-side-of-the-motorcycle-probably-coming-from-the-left-side.253641/","Date":"2024-04-10","Tags":["clutch","knocking","rebuild","rectifier","stator"]}
