{"Content":"Hi. New to this forum and I don't have a huge knowledge on bikes so I am looking for some advice on a 125cc scooter for my daughter. She has been riding an 50cc for a couple of years and is confident in city riding (lives and works around Brighton) My main question is what are everyone's thoughts on a brand new cheaper 125, such as a Sinnis Connect versus a higher end brand that is 3-5 years old with say 2-3k miles? She has about Â£1700 to spend and can get a new Sinnis with 7 year warranty for that, but has also seen a Peugeot Tweet 2018 with 3k miles for the same price. Private sale, 1 owner, well looked after. Should she go for a new cheaper brand, or an older better brand? Thanks in advance, Dan","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"New scooter advice","Author":"yellowwatford","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/new-scooter-advice.253177/","Date":"2024-02-05","Tags":[]}
