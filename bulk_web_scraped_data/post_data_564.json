{"Content":"I have a Kawasaki KZ440 LTD. I've been losing spark when riding causing me to go to the side of the road and struggle to get the bike to start again. I took off the tank and checked all wiring and found nothing suspicious. I replaced the coli, igniter and pickup coil and still the bike quits at random. Might be 50 feet or 5 miles before it quits. Yesterday in my garage I tried to start the bike but it wouldn't start. Not a peep out of it but it ran the day before. I checked my spark plug wires with my meter. I found one of the wires was dead or open...no reading with the meter. I checked further and found that the plug cap was open. Should have had 5k ohms with it as it's a resistor cap. I used a spark tester on the other cylinder and had no spark there. I thought the bike could start on one cylinder. I purchased a new cap and installed it and the bike started immediately and idles good. Haven't taken it out for a ride to test it yet due to the weather. My question....Would that bad cap kill the spark on the other cylinder? Had no spark on the second cylinder until I replaced the cap on the first cylinder. The coil is one that has the two leads going to it causing the plugs to fire at the same time. My question.....Do both plugs have to have a ground in order for the bike to run? I thought I read somewhere where they do but I can't find it. Thanks for your thoughts guys, Collieman","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"no spark","Author":"2abbydo","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/no-spark.253325/","Date":"2024-02-29","Tags":[]}
