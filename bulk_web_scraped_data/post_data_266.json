{"Content":"How's ir goin everyone and I'm really thankful for the acceptance. I have a 2000 GSX R750 ,that I bought a couple months ago. It had 3500 original miles when I picked it up. I'm around 4500 now. I've had trouble starting it,, but it's not all the time. It's almost like something is loose. I ordered a new Stator and Rectifier, the kill switch and start button housing. I'm really hoping it takes care of the problem. The bike sat outside for a while and used to be a Pro Drag bike so it has a few extras. Power Commander,full exhaust,tune and a Adams Swing Arm.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"Diamond In The RUFF","Author":"alexisgough39","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/diamond-in-the-ruff.253601/","Date":"2024-04-06","Tags":[]}
