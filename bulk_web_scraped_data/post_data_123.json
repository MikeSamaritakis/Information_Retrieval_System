{"Content":"Alright I have a 2006 genuine blur 150 (pgo 150). I have an issue where it cuts out after warm and will sometimes stall when it comes to a stop. It was my daily driver while in school and started out starting hard and led to cutting out after warm.\n\nIt takes a while to start with electric start but starts easier kick starting it. It runs fine and goes to max speed/rpm when cold but once it warms up it cuts in and out and will stall. If it stalls it’s almost impossible to start again.\n\nI have been through the carb too many times, possible enricher problem but doubtful. I adjusted the valves to spec thinking it was a fuel mixture issue but didn’t help at all. Replaced intake boot and gasket thinking it was a vacuum issue but didn’t help.\n\nChecking spark with the old plug it had spark when held to metal. I replaced the spark plug and the problem was gone. For maybe 20 miles it started and ran as it should and then the problem came back. Replaced the spark plug again and same thing. Has to be a spark issue right?\n\nCould it be coil pack, stator? It gets good fuel from the tank and carb is great. Replacing spark plug resolves the issue but not for long. What’s going on?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\n🏍 Motorcycle Forums 🏍\n🛵 Scooter Forum 🛵","Title":"Pgo g max 150 intermittent issue","Author":"jgerv","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/pgo-g-max-150-intermittent-issue.253749/","Date":"2024-04-24","Tags":["150cc","blur","genuine","pgo"]}
