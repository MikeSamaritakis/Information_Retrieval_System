{"Content":"Hello, i have a friend with a brand new sherco se 300 2t 2023. He used it for around 25 hours before it first failed. The failure comes when the vent starts the bike shuts down just as if you hit the kill switch. We changed the regulator, didnt work. Later we scanned the bike with exxotest and we found error that the temp sensor was failing so we changed that. Bike ran good for bit and started again, we changed ECU and vent electric install. Bike ran good for a week and then same failure but now when you hit the killswitch it starts the vent when bike is off. Mecanic changed the vent rele worked fine for 10 hours and started with the same failure again. Anyone knows what can it be ?
