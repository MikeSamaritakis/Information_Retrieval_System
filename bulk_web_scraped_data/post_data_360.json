I have a 05 suzuki boulevard m50 and it all of a sudden wouodnt start so i noticed some of the wiring got crushed against the part that stops the wheel from turning too far on the steering column,so I patched up anything thing that needed it and it still won't start.i got everything I didn't miss any,I even unwrapped all the wiring to expose EVERYTHING amd it all looks good.could the fact that a few got crushed maybe have shorted something out if it was a wire that had power going through it?the fuel pump doesn't make any noise when you flip the motor kill switch to deactivate (to supply power so bike will run) or is there an inline fuse somewhere that would of caught the short if that were the case?","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Wiring issue with my 05 boulevard m50 can someone please help me out?can someone please help","Author":"farminghand","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/wiring-issue-with-my-05-boulevard-m50-can-someone-please-help-me-out-can-someone-please-help.253515/","Date":"2024-03-25","Tags":[]}
