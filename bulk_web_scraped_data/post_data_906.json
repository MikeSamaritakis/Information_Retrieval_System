{"Content":"I recently bought three motorcycles in Michigan two of which have titles. Here is the problem. The orginal owner died and the person whom I bought these bikes from bought the house at auction. From my understanding this means he is the new legal owner of the bikes as they are on the property. I am going to get a bill of sale from the guy but am unsure whether this will be sufficent as his name is not on the title. I am pretty new to titling vechiles and dont know much so anything helps. Thank you!","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"titling motorcycles","Author":"Dave Gb","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/titling-motorcycles.252911/","Date":"2023-12-21","Tags":[]}
