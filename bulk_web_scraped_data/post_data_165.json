{"Content":"New to this forum after lurking for a while. Great body of knowledge here for sure!👍🏻\nI’m a 60 something returning to the road rider. Rode most of the late 70s through early 90’s while in school and early career- CB400T, CB650, Sabre 750 and Zephyr750. Then for 30 years raced HS and MX - too many to mention. My user name of Noclutch is a reference to my few years of MTB racing🥵- there ain’t no clutch to help you out of a jam.\n\nNow I’ve decided to get back to bikes that won’t beat me up so much, nor consume a whole day getting there, back and recovery. Lol. I’m not so much of a racer-type mindset anymore that I would want a full on sport bike- I wouldn’t/couldn't use it to its potential- too old for that, plus would my body wouldn’t appreciate it! But also not wanting to do the cruiser scene either- I ain’t that social. But group rides would be fine as long as they want to ride more than talk. I’ll primarily be doing low population backroads on weekend mornings at a sane pace and some local errand runs.\nWhile researching my new bike I’ve been taking note of all the things that have, and haven’t changed. After much deliberation, I decided on this. And yes, the traction control and ABS are set to full nanny for now. It reminds me of the RZ 350 I kick myself in the butt to this day for not getting!\n\n\nIf you’re in the Ocala, Florida area maybe we’ll cross paths 😊","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\n🆕 New Member Introductions 🆕","Title":"New member here with new bike :)","Author":"Noclutch","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/new-member-here-with-new-bike.253688/","Date":"2024-04-17","Tags":[]}
