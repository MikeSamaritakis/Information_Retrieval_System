{"Content":"Hi all,\n\nbought a new to me used bike last week and thought the tires looked in good shape, but I saw this today. In this a wear mark or something that just got stuck in the tire‚Ä¶almost looks like it gauged out another part of the tire. If they‚Äôre still in good condition, can I just take it to the tire shop and have them fill it? How much do I need to worry about this?\n\nThanks!\n\nJames","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Rear tire and metal","Author":"jades","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/rear-tire-and-metal.253573/","Date":"2024-04-03","Tags":[]}
