{"Content":"I put my gl500 on pods and straight pipes and re jetted the carb at 120 main 90 secondary. And now it wonâ€™t rev past 8000 rpm. Is this due to carbs being out of sync? It ran fine with pods and straight pipes before re jetting, just the occasional afterburn.do you think itâ€™s just the carbs out of sync or could it be something else?
