{"Content":"Hey All,\n\nI wasn't going to post this, but I got bored and decided what the hell. Yesterday we had record high temps and I was going to take my lil dualsport out for a ride in the woods. As I was pushing it up a ramp into my pickup bed, I took a step back and fell onto my driveway. The bike rolled out too. I ended up with an open dislocation of my left elbow and had to have the wife take me to the ER where it was surgically repaired. I'm typing this from the hospital right now. The doctors estimate a 3 month recovery. The first thing I asked was \"is the bike ok?\" and \"how soon can I ride again?\" The wife was not amused . I'm posting this as a cautionary note and am wondering if anyone else has dislocated their elbow and if so, how long it took to ride again? Let's be careful out there and no, I won't be posting any pics. Too gory.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Different kind of motorcycle mishap","Author":"Sparkman","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/different-kind-of-motorcycle-mishap.253304/","Date":"2024-02-27","Tags":[]}
