{"Content":"I always enjoy going out and completing unique Iron Butt challenges. This one was extra special and will always be my favorite certificate. Weather was terrible the whole time and I even had to make some adjustments getting to the cemetery where my dad is buried due to flood waters but was able to get it done. Here's the thing....he lived right on that corner where the road was flooded. Probably just 100 feet away. In a way it was sorta cool having to turn around in that spot that would always flood with big rains whenever I was a kid. Kinda felt like him saying, \"it's not gonna be that easy today, kiddo!\".\n\nThe unique combination of riding on our birthday, getting photos of signs that had our names, and visiting his gravesite made this one unforgettable and gratifying despite the terrible weather.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\nüèç General Motorcycle Discussion üèç","Title":"Most recent Iron Butt ride","Author":"scott7d","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/most-recent-iron-butt-ride.253677/#post-2766567","Date":"2024-04-16","Tags":[]}
