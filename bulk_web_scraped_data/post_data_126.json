{"Content":"I live in the Southend area of Essex, England. I am 72 and sonewhat disabled and have been riding motorcycles for some 56 years. How ever my health has taken a turn for the worse so last year I had to sell my MotoGuzzi Nevada 750 as it was too heavy. For over a year now I have been looking to buy a motorcycle and sidecar or a trike WITH a reverse gear for a reasonable amount of money. So far I have not been sucessful, yes there are plenty of Gold Wings that would fit the bill but they all seem to have been brought up by dealers whom want a heap of cash for them. Any idears??","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nWelcome To MotorcycleForum.com\nðŸ†• New Member Introductions ðŸ†•","Title":"Hi I am a newbe here & my namme is Berry.","Author":"berry.wilson","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/hi-i-am-a-newbe-here-my-namme-is-berry.253745/","Date":"2024-04-23","Tags":[]}
