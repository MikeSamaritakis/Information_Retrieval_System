{"Content":"I got my first ride of the season in today. Just a bit over 100 miles. The bike was flawless as usual. I got home about 20 minutes ahead of the eclipse totality of 3:12. It was definitely weird for that last 15-20 minutes with the declining light. But anyway, I was extremely happy with the ride, and now tomorrow I’m back to work. I am retired, but work part time.","Breadcrumbs":"Home\nForums\nGeneral Forums\n🏍 General Motorcycle Discussion 🏍","Title":"Seasons first ride","Author":"msjdgman","URL":"https://www.motorcycleforum.com/threads/seasons-first-ride.253622/","Date":"2024-04-08","Tags":[]}
